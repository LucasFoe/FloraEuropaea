Existing old versions of GUIFE should be removed before starting the 
installation.

GUIFE should be installed in the same place as flora.exe. It extracts the
glossary data out of flora.exe. It uses the same data as flora.exe. The 
paths to the corresponding directories should be corrected in the ini file
flora.ini. 

Only the main important parts of the original version are implemented:
- simple full text search
- all keys
- all indexes
- help function (context sensitive)

If location of directoty GAISRTF is changed, the path in following files must 
be adjusted accordingly: 
- .gais_directorylist
- .gais_inc
