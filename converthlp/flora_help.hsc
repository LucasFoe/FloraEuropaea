\par \pard\qc\b A SHORT HISTORY OF THE FLORA EUROPAEA PROJECT
\par \b0 
\par \pard It has been suggested to the Editorial Committee that this final volume should include a brief historical account of the Flora Europaea project. So as not to overload the introduction, the main events are outlined here in chronological order.
\par 
\par \f1 1954  July. At the 5 Congr\'e8s Internationale de Botanique, Paris (symposium on Progr\'e8s des Etudes des Flores Europ\'e9ennes) a rapport was given by Professor D.H. Valentine 'Progress of work on the European Flora'. No decision was taken about writing a European Flora. At an informal meeting in a brasserie on the banks of the Seine of several interested botanists including Professor T.G. Tutin (Leicester), Professor A.R. Clapham (Sheffield), Mr J.S.L. Gilmour (Cambridge), Professor N.A. Burges (Liverpool), P\f0 rofessor D.H. Valentine (Durham) and Dr V.H. Heywood (Madrid) a decision was taken that a Flora of Europe could and should be written.
\par 
\par 1955 Informal discussions took place in Britain about the feasibility of writing a European Flora. It was decided in December to hold a meeting of the working group to consider the organization of a Flora project.
\par 
\par 1956  4 January. A meeting to consider the organization of a European Flora was held at the University of Leicester. Present: Professor N.A. Burges (Liverpool), Dr V.H. Heywood (Liverpool), Professor T.G. Tutin (Leicester), Professor D.H. Valentine (Durham) and Professor D.A. Webb (Dublin). The general aim was conceived as the compilation of a Flora of Europe for the use of Universities, professional botanists, biologists, etc. - an educational work rather than a book for amateurs. The total number of species was estimated at about 12,000. An organization consisting of an Editorial Board (later Editorial Committee) with Professor Tutin as Chairman and Dr Heywood as Secretary, a panel of Advisory Editors, and a team of Regional Advisers for most countries or areas of Europe, was to be set up.
\par 
\par 1956   21-22 March. Second meeting of the Committee, at the University of Liverpool. Dr S.M. Waiters was invited to join the Committee. Several sample accounts were prepared and approved.
\par 
\par 1957 An agreement was reached with the Linnean Society of London for them to act as sponsors of the Flora Europaea project. Sample pages and a manifesto were sent to all Botany Departments in the United Kingdom, all Regional Advisers and Advisory Editors and all council members of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy. After extensive consultation a decision was taken to write the Flora in English.
\par           A grant was obtained from the Botanical Research Fund to assist with secretarial expenditure and financial help received from private individuals to keep the project going.
\par           An article was published in Taxon setting out the nature of the project and the methods of preparation being adopted.
\par \f1          A grant of \'a3750 was obtained from The Royal Society. A Leverhulme Research Fellow (Mr P.W. Ball) was appointed at the University of Liverpool to work on the Flora and it was decided to follow Engler's Syllabus, latest edition, for the sequence and circumscription of families. An agreement was reached with Professor W. Rothmaler to publish in Feddes Repertorium special taxonomic and nomenclatural notes arising out of the preparation of the Flora.\f0 
\par          An offer by Cambridge University Press to publish Flora Europaea was accepted.
\par           The Presentation of Taxonomic Information. A short Guide for Contributors to Flora Europaea compiled by V.H. Heywood, and later known as the Green Book, was published by Leicester University Press.

\par \pard\qc\b ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \b0 (Volume 1, 2nd ed.)
\par 
\par \pard\f1 The Editorial Committee gratefully acknowledges the support of the Linnean Society of London, whose Flora Europaea Trust Fund provided \'a3120,000 towards the cost of revising this volume. It has financed the employment of two full-time Research Officers, J. R. Akeroyd (1983-1988) and M. E. Newton(1990-), and has met other expenses of the Secretariat. This was helped over a difficult period by a loan from the Royal Society's scientific publications fund. Financial assistance in the form of a legacy from th\f0 e estate of the late Miss M. S. Campbell is also greatly appreciated, having provided an opportunity to commission illustrations for a new series of Notulae.
\par      In undertaking the revision of Volume 1 of \i Flora Europaea\i0  the Committee has enjoyed continued assistance and encouragement from many colleagues throughout Europe. We wish to thank them for their willing and generous co-operation. Their help has been given in many ways, some of them botanical and others technical, but all of them vital to the success of our project.
\par      We are deeply appreciative of the assistance of R.R. Mill, who compiled and checked the Appendices, and Mrs L. Walters, who transferred synonymy to the text and drew up the index. Our special thanks are due to Mrs M. Hart for typing the manuscript so diligently.
\par      In addition to the authors of individual accounts, we have received advice on particular groups from many people: J.Cullen (\i Alyssum,Aurinia\i0 ), C.R. Fraser-Jenkins (\i Polypodium\i0 ), H. Freitag (\i Chenopodiaceae\i0 ), I.C. Hedge (\i Chenopodiaceae\i0 ), M. V. Kasakova (\i Schivereckia\i0 ), R.D. Meikle (Salicaceae), C.N. Page (\i Equisetum\i0 ), J.R.Press (\i Rumex\i0 , Subgen. \i Platypodium\i0 ), C.D. Preston (Aizoaceae), K.H.Rechinger (\i Rumex\i0 ), T.C.G. Rich (\i Cruciferae\i0 ), L.-P. Ronse Decraene(\i Polygonum\i0 ), F.Rose (\i Salicornia\i0 ), G.D. Rowley (Aizoaceae,Crassulaceae), D.Tzanoudakis (\i Paeonia\i0 ), P. Uotila (\i Chenopodium\i0 )and S.D. Webster (\i Ranunculus\i0 , Subgen.\i Batrachium\i0 ). P.W. Ball, as well as editing Cruciferae, critically read many of the manuscripts, and A.C. Jermy and Miss A.M. Paul carefully checked Pteridophyta.
\par      More general comment and advice for which we are grateful was received from: H.J.M. Bowen, R.K.Brummitt, G. Buzas, E.J. Clement, D.V. Geltman, A. Hansen, J. Jalas, C.E. Jarvis, S.L. Jury, D.H. Kent, Miss C. Leon, Mrs B.Molesworth Allen, D. Nicolson, Miss E. Powell, R.W. Rutherford, P.D. Sell,C.A. Stace, J. Suominen and M.F. Watson. The Editorial Committee is also most grateful to members of the Committee for Mapping the Flora of Europe for their generosity in allowing us to consult unpublished typescripts from the \i Atlas Florae Europaeae\i0  project.
\par      The Committee acknowledges a debt of gratitude to the Directors of many Museums and Herbaria. We thank them all but wish particularly to mention the University of Cambridge ; Trinity College, Dublin; the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh; the National Museums & Galleries on Merseyside, Liverpool; the Natural History Museum, London ; and the University of Reading, the institutions whose facilities we have enjoyed for the greater part of our work.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\lang2055\f0\fs24 INTRODUCTION TO VOLUME 1 (\fs28 2nd ed.)
\par 
\par \b 
\par \b0 The aim of the Flora is in general diagnostic, and the descriptions, while brief, are as far as possible comparable for related species. The Standard Floras listed on p. xxviii, and the monographs or revisions given when appropriate after the descriptions of families and genera, may assist the reader in obtaining more detailed information. Other references to published work are occasionally given in cases of special taxonomic difficulty.
\par All available evidence, morphological, geographical, ecological and cytogenetical, has been taken into consideration in delimiting species and subspecies, but they are in all cases definable in morphological terms. (Taxa below the rank of subspecies are not normally included.)
\par The delimitation of genera is often controversial and the solution adopted in the Flora may on occasion be a somewhat arbitrary choice between conflicting opinions. We have endeavoured to weigh as fairly as possible the various opinions available, but there has been no consistent policy of 'lumping' or 'splitting' genera (or, for that matter, species). The order and circumscription of the Dicotyledones in the second edition follows that of the first edition, which was largely based on that of Engler-Diels, \i Syllabus der Pflanzenamilien \i0 ed. 11 (1936). It therefore differs in certain points from that of Melchior in Engler, S\i yllabus der Pflanzenfamilien \i0 ed. 12 (1964). The order of the Pteridophyta follows Derrick, Jermy and Paul, \i Sommerfeltia\b  \i0 6\b0 : 1-94 (1987).
\par All descriptions of taxa refer only to their representatives in Europe. In practice, we have relaxed this rule slightly for families and genera to avoid giving taxonomically misleading information, particularly in those cases where a large family or genus has only one or few, perhaps atypical, members in Europe. In such cases we have occasionally added ' in European members' or a similar phrase to emphasize the atypical representation. In no case, however, should it be assumed that the description is valid for all the non-European representatives of these taxa.
\par Often a short note follows the description of a species or, occasionally, a genus, containing additional information of various kinds.
\par 
\par 
\par \pard\qc\i (a) Choice of language
\par 
\par \pard\i0 Much thought was given to the question of the best language for the Flora. There were many reasons in favour of English, but the alternative of Latin also had much to commend it. After consulting the Regional Advisers, we decided in favour of English. Opinion in Europe was fairly evenly divided, but it seemed likely that whereas in some European countries the professional taxonomist might prefer Latin, the general botanist and other biologists would prefer English. It was also clear that outside Europe English would be preferred. As we were anxious to make the Flora available to as wide a circle of readers as possible, we felt that these considerations were decisive.
\par We have tried, however, to bear in mind throughout the writing and editing of the work that it will be used by many readers whose knowledge of English is very imperfect. For this reason we have restricted ourselves to a much smaller technical vocabulary than is usual, believing that the gain in ease of understanding would offset the small loss of precision sometimes involved. For the same reason, in most cases where there are two English words with the same meaning, we have preferred the one derived from a Latin root. A glossary has been added, whose purpose is not the usual one of explaining technical terms in simple language (which is impracticable on an international basis), but of giving a Latin equivalent of those English words which are important for an understanding of the text, and which differ substantially from their Latin equivalents. We have also provided a short fist of English definitions of those terms which experience has shown to be open to misconstruction.
\par Place-names used in the summary of geographical distribution have been given in their English form when they refer to independent States or to such geographical features of Europe as transcend national boundaries. All other place-names are given in the language of the country concerned. Thus we write \i Sweden, Ukraine, Danube, Alps, Mediterranean, \i0 but \i Corse, Kriti, Rodopi Planina, Ahvenanmaa. Macedonia \i0 is written in its English form if reference is intended to the whole of the region that has traditionally been known by that name; but the Jugoslav and Greek administrative units are referred to as \i Makedonija \i0 and \i Makedhonia \i0 respectively.
\par In transliteration from Cyrillic characters we have, as far as place-names and titles of publications are concerned, followed the ISO system recommended in the UNESCO \i Bulletin for Libraries \i0 10: 136-137 (1956). This is almost identical with the system recommended by Paclt in \i Taxon \i0 2: 159 (1953). Both are based essentially on the conventions of Serbo-Croat and, although the number of diacritical signs which they require is an undoubted disadvantage, they are the only systems which have any real claim to be considered international, all others in current use being based frankly on the acceptance of German or English conventions of pronunciation. With personal names, however, we have been influenced by the fact that Russian botanists, in transliterating their own names, usually follow German conventions; we have therefore followed the list of transliterations given in the index-volume (1962) to \i Not. Syst. (Leningrad)/Botaniceskie Materialj, \i0 and have transliterated personal names which do not occur in this list according to the same conventions.
\par In transliterating place-names from Greek characters we have, except for omitting the accents, followed \i The Times Atlas of the World, Mid-Century Edition, \i0 vol. 4 (London, 1956).
\par 
\par 
\par \pard\qc\i (b) Delimitation of Europe
\par 
\par \pard\i0 We have tried as far as possible to interpret ' Europe' for the purposes of this Flora in its traditional sense. There is no doubt that phytogeographically a more natural unit would be a Greater Europe', bounded by the Sahara desert and the great deserts of Asia, and including, therefore, North Africa and much of south-west Asia. But to have attempted to cover this area would have more than doubled our task and would have meant the inclusion of a disproportionately large number of plants whose status and identity are very uncertain. Europe in its traditional sense, however, is completely covered by Floras which, although they vary widely in competence and modernity, reduce the unsolved problems of taxonomy and distribution to a more reasonable compass.
\par In framing a precise definition of Europe in this traditional sense three questions arose : where the boundary with Asia was to be drawn in eastern Russia and Kazakhstan; where it was to be drawn in the Aegean region; and which islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans were to be included.
\par Some confusion may be caused by apparent differences in geographical distribution in the former territories of the U.S.S.R. between our data and those of the invaluable \i Flora Partis europaeae URSS. \i0 In a few cases they arise from differences of taxonomic opinion, or of judgements as to the status of a plant (casual, naturalized or native), but in most cases they can be attributed to the fact that the divisions used in that Flora are, though very similar to ours, not quite identical. This is because Fedorov, in the map published in the first volume of his Flora, very sensibly made his boundaries follow the lines of administrative divisions, whereas we had perforce to follow the not very precisely indicated boundaries of Komarov's divisions, which were ecologically and floristically based and paid no attention to administrative boundaries. The most important divergences are in northern Ukraine, southern Ural, and the region north-east of St Petersburg. These are included by Fedorov in his western (Zapad), eastern (Vostok) and northern (Sever) divisions respectively, whereas for us they all fall into Rs(C). There is also a divergence in the line delimiting Europe in the cis-Caucasian region: Fedorov includes a large part of the Stavropol plateau, which we exclude from Europe.
\par It will be seen that, in the Arctic, Franz Joseph Land (Zemlja Franca Josifa) and Novaja Zemlja are excluded, but the islands of Kolguev and Vajgac are included ; that the boundary is then defined by the crest of the Ural Mountains (with a small deviation eastwards near Sverdlovsk ) and the Ural River to the Caspian Sea (thus including in Europe a small portion of W. Kazakhstan) ; and that the whole of the Caucasus is excluded.
\par In the Aegean region we have drawn our boundary along the deep-water channel which separates the Sporadhes and the islands lying close to the mainland of Anatolia from those of the C. and W. Aegean. The only large islands under Greek sovereignty which are excluded from Europe are the Sporadhes, Khios, Lesvos and Rodhos. The only island under Turkish sovereignty which is included in Europe is Imroz; Bozcaada (Tenedos) and all the islands in the Sea of Marmara are excluded. Cyprus is also excluded.
\par \f1 All other islands in the Mediterranean (except those administered from Africa) are included in Europe, as are also the A\'e7ores, F\'e6r\'f6er, Iceland, Jan Mayen, Bj\'f6rn\'f6ya (Bear Island) and Svalbard (Spitsbergen).\f0 
\par 
\par \pard\qc\i (c)Keys
\par \i0 
\par \pard Artificial dichotomous keys are provided within families and genera, and, where necessary, within species. A general key to families is also given (p. xxxiii), which includes all the families in the European flora, not only those described in this volume. The keys have been designed to be practical, and do not in general use characters which are difficult to observe, even if important taxonomically ; they have also been kept as brief as possible. We have tried to give characters useful both in the herbarium and in the field, though this has often been difficult because of the lack of information about field characters in certain areas, notably S.E. Europe.
\par The choice of the indented key was made only after thorough discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the many possible types of key. Briefly, the advantage of the indented key is that it may also act to some extent as a conspectus; in \i Papaver, \i0 for example, it separates the scapose species of the section \i Meconella \i0 from the rest of the genus. In this way similar species are often grouped together in the key , and identification of an unknown plant is facilitated. On the other hand, we have not hesitated to key out more than once certain taxa in which the relevant characters are variable.
\par 
\par 
\par \pard\qc\i (d) Citation and synonymy
\par \i0 
\par \pard The use of abbreviations for author and place of publication has been standardized as far as possible, and lists of these abbreviations are given in Appendices I, II and III.
\par It is important to note that no attempt has been made to give a complete synonymy. Even at the binomial level, the number of names for European plants is four or five times the number of accepted species, and to include all these would be impracticable. Synonyms, whether full or partial, are given only when they are used or included in one of the Standard Floras or when they are necessary to prevent confusion. Synonyms (or the basionym) are also usually given when the combination has not previously been used in a Flora or monograph, or when the nomenclature is unfamiliar or in need of explanation. Where the name of a familiar species has been changed, an explanation has usually been published as a Notula (see Section (\i j\i0 )).
\par 
\par 
\par \pard\qc\i (e) Species descriptions
\par 
\par \pard\i0 In order to save space and facilitate identification, descriptions may take the form of a comparison with another description. The conventional way of setting this out is, to give an example (p. 212):
\par 
\par \pard\qc\b 131. Silene dioica\b0  (L.) Clairv ...Like \b 129\b0  but...
\par 
\par \pard This implies that the description with which it is being compared (in this example 129) applies to this taxon but for the differences noted. It does not necessarily mean that the two taxa are similar in appearance or that they are closely related. Additional descriptive information is sometimes also given, but in separate sentences.
\par Where dimensions are given, a measurement without qualification refers to length. Two measurements connected by x indicate length followed by width. Further measurements in parentheses indicate exceptional cases outside the normal ranges.
\par The \i diploid chromosome number \i0 (2n = ) is given where it has been possible to verify that the count was made on material of-known wild European origin. Details of those included in the first edition were provided by Moore, \i Flora Europaea Check-list and Chromosome Index, \i0 1982, but subsequently published data have also been included in this revision.
\par \i Ecological information \i0 has been given very sparingly, and only where the ecological characteristics of a species are clearly and concisely definable for its total European range. There is an inevitable irregularity of treatment in this respect, but here, as with chromosome number, the Editorial Committee has thought it best to include only well-verified statements.
\par The description of each species is followed by an indication of its \i distribution within Europe. \i0 This falls into two parts: (1) a summary in a short phrase; (2) a list of abbreviations of 'territories' in which the species occurs. The summary phrase makes use of everyday geographical phrases and concepts such as 'W. Europe', 'the Mediterranean region', 'the Balkan peninsula', etc. Maps IV and V and the lists accompanying them indicate the interpretation which is to be put on these phrases. We would emphasize that they are to be interpreted in a simple geographical sense, and do not attempt in any way to divide Europe phytogeographically.
\par \f1 Species or subspecies believed to be endemic to Europe are distinguished by a symbol (\bullet ) before the summary of geographical distribution.\f0 
\par A more precise indication of distribution is given by the enumeration of the 'territories' (indicated by two-letter abbreviations from Latin) in which the plant is believed to occur. The limits of these territories follow, with very few exceptions, existing political boundaries. An alternative plan, which has been suggested by several colleagues, of dividing Europe into floristic regions and ignoring political boundaries would seem at first sight to have much to commend it. It is, however, impracticable for two reasons. First, although there is some agreement as to the broad primary units into which Europe might be divided floristically, there is no agreement on where exactly their boundaries are to be drawn, or on how they should be subdivided into smaller units of convenient size. Secondly, the information is more readily available in political than in phytogeographical terms. For rare or localised species it would have been possible to translate the information from one system to the other; but for wide-ranging species, which are described as occurring, for example, \i\f1 dans une grande partie de la France mais tr\'e8s rare dans la r\'e9gion m\'e9diterran\'e9enne, \i0\f0 the assignment to phytogeographical areas would have meant a search of local Floras and herbaria quite beyond the powers of authors or editors in the time available.
\par \f1 The political divisions have, therefore, been accepted. Each territory represents a sovereign State, with the following exceptions: Certain islands or island-groups have, on account of their size, isolation, or floristic peculiarities, been treated as separate territories. These comprise Kriti, Corse, Sardegna, Sicilia, Islas Baleares, F\'e6r\'f6er, Svalbard, A\'e7ores. Malta is grouped with Sicilia, and the Channel Islands are grouped with France. Ireland and Jugoslavia are each treated as a single territory. T\f0 he former U.S.S.R. has been subdivided, not according to its constituent republics (though these are often referred to by name in the geographical summary), but into six divisions formed by grouping together the floristic regions used in \i Flora URSS. \i0 A small adjustment has been made in the N. and E. Ukraine, so as to bring the boundaries as far as possible into line with those which delimit the regions used in \i Flora RSS Ucr. \i0 The territories, of course, vary greatly in size, and Ga, Hs or Ju gives much less precise information than does Fa, Rs(K) or Tu. In all cases, however, the lists provide a statement as to which national Floras should be searched for further detailed information, whether on distribution or on taxonomy.
\par Occasionally the list of territories is followed by a brief indication, in parentheses, of extra European distribution. We should, perhaps, explain why we have not done this for all species - a policy that was urged on us by many of our advisers. It is simply because we found that in far too many cases the information was not available. It is one thing to note that a plant has been recorded from China, from tropical Africa, or from North America under the same name as a European species; it is a very different matter to find out whether, in the opinion of a competent taxonomist, the two should really be judged as conspecific. We therefore thought it better to say nothing than to give further currency to data which have not been critically sifted and which contain many erroneous records. The only exceptions to this rule are for plants not native in Europe and for plants of which the-European range is only a small fraction of their total area. If the only European record for a plant is from a limited area of S. Spain the reader may well wish to know whether it is strictly endemic there, or is found also across the straits in Morocco, or is a wide-ranging plant of North Africa that has established a small bridgehead in    Europe. The three cases would be distinguished thus:
\par \f1            \bullet  \i\f0 S. Spain. \i0 Hs.      indicates endemic to S. Spain, 
\par \i              S. Spain. \i0 Hs.       indicates found also outside Europe, 
\par \i              S. Spain. \i0 Hs. (\i N\i0 . \i Africa.)      \i0 indicates widespread also in North 
\par                                                          Africa; not primarily a European plant.
\par 
\par 
\par \pard\qc\i (f) Infraspecific taxa
\par 
\par \pard\i0 In general the only infraspecific taxa described and keyed in the Flora are subspecies. Any formal treatment of variation below the level of subspecies would have been impossible in a Flora of this kind ; most of the known variation of taxa is, however, covered in the descriptions. Taxa below the level of subspecies may be mentioned when, in the opinion of the author, they seem to have some claim to recognition at higher rank, but require further investigation. Conversely, many taxa published as species or subspecies, but whose claim to the rank seems-doubtful, are described or briefly mentioned in supplementary notes under the species to which they seem most closely related.
\par No 'experimental' categories, such as ecotypes, are used in the Flora in a formal systematic sense, though they are sometimes mentioned in notes.
\par 
\par 
\par \pard\qc\i (g) Treatment of critical groups\i0 
\par 
\par \pard In certain cases where it is difficult to distinguish between a number of closely similar species, an \i ad hoc \i0 'group' has-been made, and these groups, not the individual species, are keyed out in the main species-key. They will serve for at least a partial identification. Following the description of a group in the text, a key to the component species is given, and they are then numbered and described so that a more detailed study, or the use of more adequate material, may enable the user to take the identification further. For example, in \i Stellaria \i0 there is the \i S. media \i0 group, which comprises the species \i S. media \i0 (L.) Vill., \i S. neglecta \i0 Weihe and \i S. pallida \i0 (Dumort.) Pire. Such groups have no taxonomic or nomenclatural status.
\par For the inbreeding and apomictic groups, other \i ad hoc \i0 treatments have been devised. The general approach to such groups is set out and discussed in detail in the Report of the first Flora Europaea Symposium in \i Feddes Repert. \i0 63: 107-228 (1961).
\par 
\par 
\par \pard\qc\i (h) Treatment of hybrids
\par \i0 
\par \pard Only those few hybrids which reproduce vegetatively and are frequent over a reasonably large area (e.g. \i Sagina \i0 x \i normaniana) \i0 are described and keyed as for species. Other common hybrids may be mentioned individually in notes (e.g. \i Silene dioica \i0 x \i latifolia), \i0 or collectively for the whole genus (e.g. \i Quercus).
\par \i0 
\par 
\par \pard\qc\i (i) Alien species
\par 
\par \pard\i0 The question of which alien species should be included is a difficult one for any Flora, and the difficulty is even greater on a continental scale. We have attempted to include the following categories: 
\par              (i) Aliens which are effectively naturalized. These include garden plants which have escaped to situations not immediately adjacent to those in which they are cultivated, as well as weeds and other plants which have been accidentally introduced ; provided, in both cases, that the plant has been established in at least one station for at least 25 years, or is reported as naturalized in a number of widely separated localities. 
\par             (ii) Trees or crop-plants which are planted or cultivated in continuous stands on a fairly extensive scale.
\par 
\par Casual aliens, i.e. those which do not persist without constant fresh introductions, are not included unless they have often been mistaken for a native or established species, or are for any other reason of special interest.
\par In assessing the status of a species in any part of Europe we have, however, been dependent almost entirely on the information contained in the national Floras, and it is clear that the criteria used by different authors vary widely. There are some genera, for example \i Chenopodium\i0 , in\i  \i0 which every transitional state from a casual to a well-established weed can be observed. All data on native, established or casual status relating to weeds or other 'palaeosynanthropic' plants must, therefore, be regarded only as approximate.
\par 
\par 
\par \pard\qc\i (j) Publication of \i0 Novitates
\par \i 
\par \pard\i0 In the process of writing the accounts, new material requiring publication has naturally been brought together. For the publication of much of this material, the Committee made an arrangement with the Editorial Board of \i Feddes Repertorium, \i0 by which taxonomic and nomenclatural notes were published as part of a series entitled \i Notulae Systematicae ad Floram Europaeam spectantes. \i0 The first of these appeared in 1961. From 1971 such \i Notulae \i0 were published in the \i Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society. \i0 This continued until 1979, with the completion of the Flora in 1980. Beginning in 1987, a new series of \i Notulae \i0 relating to the revision of \i Flora Europaea \i0 vol. 1 has also been published in the \i Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society. \i0 By these arrangements, publication of new names or combinations in the Flora itself has been avoided.

\par \fs28 
\par \pard\fi375\tqc\tx565\tqc\tx6515 The aim of the Flora is in general diagnostic, and the descriptions, while brief, are as far as possible comparable for related species. The Floras listed on pp. xvii-xix, and the monographs or revisions given when appropriate after the descriptions of families and genera, may assist the reader in obtaining more detailed information. Other references to published work are occasionally given in cases of special taxonomic difficulty.
\par \pard\fi375\tx3535 All available evidence, morphological, geographical, ecological and cytogenetical, has been taken into consideration in delimiting species and subspecies, but they are in all cases definable in morphological terms. (Taxa below the rank of subspecies are not normally included.) The delimitation of genera is often controversial and the solution adopted in the Flora may be a somewhat arbitrary choice between conflicting opinions. We have endeavoured to weigh as fairly as possible the various opinions available, but there has been no consistent policy of 'lumping' or 'splitting' genera (or, for that matter, species). The order and circumscription of the families is that of Melchior in\b\i  \b0 Engler-Diels, Syllabus der Pflanzenfamilien ed\b . \b0\i0 12 (1964). Since, however, this edition of the \i Syllabus\b  \b0\i0 did\b\i  \b0\i0 not appear until Volume 1 of the Flora had gone to press, there are some small discrepancies between the two with regard to the sequence of families. In particular, the Cactaceae and Guttiferae, which should have been in Volume 1, have been inserted in Volume 2.
\par All descriptions of taxa refer only to their representatives in Europe. In practice, we have relaxed this rule slightly for families and genera to avoid giving taxonomically misleading information, particularly in those cases where a large family or genus has only one or few, somewhat atypical, members in Europe. In such cases we have occasionally added 'in European members' or a similar phrase to emphasize the atypical representation. It should, however, never be assumed that the description is valid for all non-European taxa.
\par For the purpose of this Flora, we have tried as far as possible to interpret Europe in its traditional sense. The area covered is shown on the maps at the end of the volume.
\par \i Place-names\b  \b0\i0 used in the summaries of geographical distribution have been given in their English form when they refer to independent states (including the constituent republics of the U.S.S.R.) or to such geographical features of Europe as transcend national boundaries. All other place-names are given in the language of the country concerned. Thus we write \i Sweden, Ukraine, Danube, Alps, Mediterranean \i0 but \i Corse, Kriti, Slovenija, Rodopi Planina\b , \b0 Ahvenanmaa\b .\b0\i0 
\par In \i transliteration\i0  from\b\i  \b0\i0 Cyrillic characters we have followed the ISO system recommended in the UNESCO \i Bulletin for Libraries\b  \i0 10\b0 : 137 (1956) for place-names and titles of journals. With personal names, however, we have followed the list of transliterations given in the index-volume (1962) to \i Not.\b  \b0 Syst. (Leningrad),\b  \b0\i0 and have transliterated personal names which do not occur in this list according to the conventions used there.
\par In transliterating place-names from Greek characters, we have, except for omitting the accents, followed \i The Times Atlas of the World, \i0 Mid-Century Edition, vol. 4 (London, 1956).
\par  On pp. xvii-xix, we give a list of \i Basic and Standard Floras. \i0 The reason behind the choice of these Floras was not made clear in Volume 1. Basic Floras have been chosen as widely known Floras\b  \b0 covering large or important parts of Europe. Standard Floras are considered to represent those Floras in current use and likely to be familiar to a large number of people in the particular country concerned; the list has been revised since the publication of Volume\b  1.
\par \b0\i Synonyms\b , \b0\i0 whether full or partial, are given in parentheses in the text only when they are used in one of the Basic Floras or when they are necessary to prevent confusion. (For primarily Iberian and Mediterranean species, synonyms used in the \i Prodromus\b  \b0\i0 of\b\i  \b0\i0 Willkonnn & Lange, and the \i Supplementum\b  \b0\i0 by Willkomm (p. xix) are also included.) Synonyms (or the basionym) are also usually given in the text when the combination has not previously been used in a Flora or monograph, or when the nomenclature is otherwise unfamiliar or in need of explanation. Otherwise, synonyms are given in the Index only; but it is important to note that no attempt has been made to give a complete synonymy. Even at the binomial level, the number of names for European plants is four or five times the number of accepted species, and to include all these would be impracticable. Thus, in addition to the binomials in the text, the Index contains all synonyms at specific rank which are used in the Basic and Standard Floras, or in cited monographs, with an indication of the species in the text under which they have been relegated to synonymy. Some subspecific names also appear in the Index. In this way, we hope that users of any Basic or Standard Flora will be able to relate the names used in their own Floras to those in \i Flora Europaea\b . \b0\i0 In\b\i  \b0\i0 cases where the name of a familiar species has been changed, an explanation of this is usually published as a Notula (see p. xvi).
\par \i Citations\b  \b0\i0 have been abbreviated,and the abbreviations used for authors and places of publication have been standardized; lists of these abbreviations are given in Appendices I, II and III. These lists apply only to the abbreviations used in Volume 2.
\par \i Species descriptions\b  \b0\i0\f1 attempt to give, within the limits of length set by the Flora, both the diagnostic characters of the plant and a general idea of its appearance. Where dimensions are given, a measmement without qualification refers to length. Two measurements connected by \'d7 indicate length followed by width. Further measurements in parentheses indicate exceptional sizes outside the normal ranges. In order to save space and facilitate identification, descriptions may sometimes take the form of a comparison with another d\f0 escription. The conventional way of setting this out is, to give an example (p. 41):
\par \pard\fi375\qc\tx3535\b\f1 16. Potentilla chamissonis Hult\'e9n...\b0\f0 Like\b  15 \b0 but\b ...
\par \pard\fi375\tx3535\b0 This implies that the description with which it is being compared (in this example \b 15. P. nivea \b0 L.) applies to this taxon but for the differences noted. It does not necessarily mean that the two taxa are similar in general appearance. Additional descriptive information is sometimes also given, but in separate sentences.
\par The \i diploid chromosome number\b  \b0\i0 (2\i n\i0 = ) is given where it has been possible to verify that the count was made on material of known wild European origin. For naturalized and cultivated species, the count is from material which is naturalized or is cultivated in the way which justifies its inclusion in the Flora. It is hoped to publish separately a list of references to the data on which the published numbers are based.
\par \i Ecological information\b  \b0\i0 is given sparingly, and only where the ecological characteristics of a species are clearly and concisely definable for its total European range. Sometimes a general statement, applicable to a whole genus or to a group of species, is made. There is an inevitable irregularity of treatment, as in a great many cases reliable ecological information is not available.
\par  The description of each species is followed by an indication of its \i distribution within Europe. \i0 This falls into two parts: (1) a summary in a short phrase; (2) a list of abbreviations of 'territories' in which the species occurs. The summary phrase makes use of everyday geographical phrases and concepts such as 'W. Europe', 'the Mediterranean region', 'the Balkan peninsula', etc. Maps IV\b  \b0 and V and the legends accompanying them indicate the interpretation which is to be put on these phrases. We would emphasize that they are to be interpreted in a simple geographical sense, and do not attempt in any way to divide Europe phytogeographically.
\par \f1 Species believed to be endemic to Europe are distinguished by a symbol (\bullet ) before the summary of geographical distribution.\f0 
\par A more precise indication of distribution is given by the enumeration of the 'territories' (indicated by a two-letter abbreviation) in which the plant is believed to occur. The limits of these territories follow, with very few exceptions, existing political boundaries (see Map I). The territories, of course, vary greatly in size, and Ga, Hs or Ju gives very much less information than does Fa, Rs(K) or Tu. In all cases, however, the lists provide a guide to which national Floras should be searched for further detailed information, whether on taxonomy or on distribution. Occasionally, the list of territories is followed by a brief indication, in parentheses, of extra-European distribution. This is done only for plants of which the European range is but a small fraction of the total and for species not native in Europe.
\par In general the only infraspecific taxa described and keyed in the Flora are subspecies. Any formal treatment of variation below the level of subspecies would have been impossible in a Flora of this kind; the known variation of taxa is, however, covered in the descriptions. No 'experimental' categories, such as ecotypes, are used in the Flora in a formal systematic sense, though they are sometimes mentioned in notes.
\par Where it is difficult to distinguish between a number of closely similar species in a genus, an \i ad hoc\b  \b0\i0 'group' has been made, and these groups, not the individual species, are keyed out in the main species key. They will serve for at least a partial identification. Following the description of a group in the text, a key to the component species is given, and they are then numbered and described, so that a more detailed study, or the availability of more adequate material, may enable the user to take the identification further. For example, in\b\i  \b0 Potentilla\b  \b0\i0 there is the \i P. argentea \i0 group, which comprises the species \i P. argentea \i0 L., \i P. calabra \i0 Ten. and \i P. neglecta \i0 Baumg. Such groups have no nomenclatural status.
\par For inbreeding and apomictic groups, other \i ad hoc\b  \b0\i0 treatments have been devised. In Volume 2, the main problems have arisen in the Rosaceae; the methods used to overcome them are described in the notes following the descriptions of that family and the genera concerned.
\par Only those few \i hybrids\b  \b0\i0 which reproduce vegetatively and are frequent over a reasonably large area (e.g. \i Circaea \b\f1\'d7 \b0\f0 intermedia) \i0 are described and keyed as for species. Other common hybrids may be mentioned individually in notes (e.g. in \i Viola), \i0 or collectively for the whole genus (e.g. in \i Epilobium). \b 
\par \b0\i0 We have attempted to include the following categories of \i alien species\i0 :\b\i  
\par \b0\i0 (i) Aliens which are effectively naturalized. These include garden plants which have escaped to situations not immediately adjacent to those in which they are cultivated, as well as weeds and other plants which have been accidentally introduced; provided, in both cases, that the plant has been established in a single station for at least 25 years, or is reported as naturalized in a number of widely separated localities.
\par (ii) Trees or crop-plants which are planted or cultivated in continuous stands on a fairly extensive scale.
\par Casual aliens, i.e. those which do not persist without repeated re-introduction, are not included unless they have often been mistaken for a native or established species, or are for any other reason of special interest. In assessing the status of a species in any part of Europe we have, however, been dependent very largely on the information contained in the national Floras, and it is clear that the criteria used by different authors vary widely. All data on native, naturalized or casual status relating to synanthropic plants must, therefore, be regarded only as approximate.
\par It is the policy of the Committee not to publish new names in the Flora itself. To deal with the publication of much of this material, an arrangement has been made with the Editorial Board of \i Feddes Repertorium\b , \b0\i0 by which taxonomic and nomenclatural notes are being published as part of a series entitled \i Notulae Systematicae ad Floram Europaeam spectantes\b ; \b0\i0 the first six parts of these have already appeared.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\lang2055\f0\fs24 INTRODUCTION TO VOLUME 3
\par \pard\fi375\sl275\slmult0\fs28 
\par \pard\fi355 The aim of the Flora is in general diagnostic, and the descriptions, while brief, are as far as possible comparable for related species. The Floras listed on pp. xix-xxi, and the monographs or revisions given when appropriate after the descriptions of families and genera, may assist the reader in obtaining more detailed information. Other references to published work are occasionally given in cases of special taxonomic difficulty.
\par \pard\fi375 All available evidence, morphological, geographical, ecological and cytogenetical, has been taken into consideration in delimiting species and subspecies, but they are in all cases definable in morphological terms. (Taxa below the rank of subspecies are not normally included.) The delimitation of genera is often controversial and the solution adopted in the Flora may be a somewhat arbitrary choice between conflicting opinions. We have endeavoured to weigh as fairly as possible the various opinions available, but there has been no consistent policy of 'lumping' or 'splitting' genera (or, for that matter, species). The order and circumscription of the families is that of Melchior in Engler, \i Syllabus der Pflanzenfamilien ed.\b  \b0\i0 12 (1964). Since, however, this edition of the \i Syllabus \i0 did not appear until Volume 1 of the Flora had gone to press, there are some small discrepancies between the two with regard to the sequence of families. In particular, the Cactaceae and Guttiferae, which should have been in Volume 1, were inserted in Volume 2. The main text of the Rubiaceae will appear in Volume 4, as noted on p. 73.
\par All descriptions of taxa refer only to their representatives in Europe. In practice, we have relaxed this rule slightly for families and genera to avoid giving taxonomically misleading information, particularly in those cases where a large family or genus has only one or few, somewhat atypical, members in Europe. In such cases we have occasionally added 'in European members' or a similar phrase to emphasize the atypical representation. It should, however, never be assumed that the description is valid for all non-European taxa.
\par For the purpose of this Flora, we have tried as far as possible to interpret Europe in its traditional sense. The area covered is shown on the maps at the end of the volume.
\par \i Place-names\b  \b0\i0 used in the summaries of geographical distribution have been given in their English form when they refer to independent states (including the constituent republics of the U.S.S.R.) or to such geographical features of Europe as transcend national boundaries. All other place-names are given in the language of the country concemed. Thus we write \i Sweden, Ukraine,\b  \b0 Danube, Alps, Mediterranean\b  \b0\i0 but \i Corse, Kriti, Slovenija, Rodopi Planina\b , \b0 Ahvenanmaa.\i0 
\par In \i transliteration\i0  from\b\i  \b0\i0 Cyrillic characters we have followed the ISO system recommended in the UNESCO \i Bulletin for Libraries\b  \i0 10\b0 : 136-137 (1956) for place-names and titles of journals. With personal names, however, we have followed the list of transliterations given in the index-volume (1962) to \i Not. Syst. \i0 (\i Leningrad\i0 ),\b\i  \b0\i0 and have transliterated personal names which do not occur in this list according to the conventions used there.
\par In transliterating place-names from Greek characters, we have, except for omitting the accents, followed \i The Times Atlas of the World\b , \b0\i0 Mid-Century Edition, vol. 4 (London, 1956).
\par On pp. xix-xxi, we give a list of \i Basic and Standard Floras\b . \b0\i0 The reason behind the choice of these Floras was not made clear in Volume 1. Basic Floras have been chosen as widely known Floras covering large or important parts of Europe. Standard Floras are considered to represent those Floras in current use and likely to be familiar to a large number of people in the particular country concerned; the list has been revised since the publication of Volume 2.
\par \pard\i     Synonyms\b , \b0\i0 whether full or partial, are given in parentheses in the text only when they are used in one of the Basic Floras or when they are necessary to prevent confusion. (For primarily Iberian and Mediterranean species, synonyms used in the \i Prodromus\i0  of\b\i  \b0\i0 Willkomm & Lange, and the \i Supplementum\b  \b0\i0 by Willkomm (p. xxi) are also included.) Synonyms (or the basionym) are also usually given in the text when the combination has not previously been used in a Flora or monograph, or when the nomenclature is otherwise unfamiliar or in need of explanation. Otherwise, synonyms are given in the Index only; but it is important to note that no attempt has been made to give a complete synonymy. Even at the binomial level, the number of names for European plants is four or five times the number of accepted species, and to include all these would be impracticable. Thus, in addition to the binomials in the text, the Index contains all synonyms at specific rank which are used in the Basic and Standard Floras, or in cited monographs, with an indication of the species in the text under which they have been relegated to synonymy. Some subspecific names also appear in the Index. In this way, we hope that users of any Basic or Standard Flora will be able to relate the names used in their own Floras to those in \i Flora Europaea\i0 . In\b\i  \b0\i0 cases where the name of a familiar species has been changed, an explanation of this is usually published as a Notula (see p. xviii).
\par \pard\fi375\i Citations \i0 have been abbreviated, and the abbreviations used for authors and places of publication have been standardized; lists of these abbreviations are given in Appendices I, II and III. These lists apply only to the abbreviations used in Volume 3.
\par \i Species descriptions\b  \b0\i0\f1 attempt to give, within the limits of length set by the Flora, both the diagnostic characters of the plant and a general idea of its appearance. Where dimensions are given, a measurement without qualification refers to length. Two measurements connected by \'d7 indicate length followed by width. Further measurements in parentheses indicate exceptional sizes outside the normal ranges. In order to save space and facilitate identification, descriptions may sometimes take the form of a comparison with another \f0 description. The conventional way of setting this out is, to give an example (p. 233):
\par \pard\fi985\b 44. Linaria lilacina Lange...\b0 Like\b  \b0 43 but... 
\par \pard\fi375 This implies that the description with which it is being compared (in this example \b 43\b0 . \b L. anticaria \b0 Boiss. & Reuter) applies to this taxon but for the differences noted. It does not necessarily mean that the two taxa are similar in general appearance. Additional descriptive information is sometimes also given, but in separate sentences.
\par \pard\fi95 The \i diploid chromosome number \i0 (2\i n\i0 = ) is given where it has been possible to verify that the count was made on material of known wild European origin. For naturalized and cultivated species, the count is from material which is naturalized or is cultivated in the way which justifies its inclusion in the Flora. It is hoped to publish separately a list of references to the data on which the published numbers are based.
\par \pard\i Ecological information \i0 is given sparingly, and only where the ecological characteristics of a species are clearly and concisely definable for its total European range. Sometimes a general statement, applicable to a whole genus or to a group of species, is made. There is an inevitable irregularity of treatment, as in a great many cases reliable ecological information is not available.
\par  The description of each species is followed by an indication of its \i distribution within Europe. \i0 This falls into two parts: (1) a summary in a short phrase; (2) a list of abbreviations of 'territories' in which the species occurs. The summary phrase makes use of everyday geographical phrases and concepts such as 'W. Europe', 'the Meditemanean region', 'the Balkan peninsula', etc. Maps IV and V and the legends accompanying them indicate the intertation which is to be put on these phrases. We would emphasize that they are to be interpreted in a simple geographical sense, and do not attempt in any way to divide Europe phytogeographically.
\par \pard\fi375\f1 Species believed to be endemic to Europe are distinguished by a symbol (\bullet ) before the summary of geographical distribution.\f0 
\par A more precise indication of distribution is given by the enumeration of the 'territories' (indicated by a two-letter abbreviation) in which the plant is believed to occur. The limits of these territories follow, with very few exceptions, existing political boundaries (see Map I). The territories, of course, vary greatly in size, and Ga, Hs or Ju gives very much less information than does Fa, Rs(K) or Tu. In all cases, however, the lists provide a guide to which national Floras should be searched for further detailed information, whether on taxonomy or on distribution. Occasionally, the list of territories is followed by a brief indication, in parentheses, of extra-European distribution. This is done only for plants of which the European range is but a small fraction of the total and for species not native in Europe.
\par In general the only infraspecific taxa described and keyed in the Flora are subspecies. Any formal treatment of variation below the level of subspecies would have been impossible in a Flora of this kind; the known variation of taxa is, however, covered in the descriptions. No 'experimental' categories, such as ecotypes, are used in the Flora in a formal systematic sense, though they are sometimes mentioned in notes.
\par \pard\fi235 Where it is difficult to distinguish between a number of closely similar species in a genus, an \i ad hoc \i0 'group' has been made, and these groups, not the individual species, are keyed out in the main species key. They will serve for at least a partial identification. Following the description of a group in the text, a key to the component species is given, and they are then numbered and described, so that a more detailed study, or the availability of more adequate material, may enable the user to take the identification further. For example, in \i Linaria \i0 there is the \i L. arvensis \i0 group, which comprises the species \i L. arvensis \i0 (L.) Desf., \i L. simplex \i0 (Willd.) DC. and \i L. micrantha \i0 (Cav.) Hoffmanns. & Link. Such groups have no nomenclatural status.
\par For some of the difficult hemiparasitic genera in the Scrophulariaceae, other \i ad hoc\b  \b0\i0 treatments have been devised; these are described in the notes following the descriptions of the genera concerned.
\par Only those few \i hybrids \i0 which reproduce vegetatively and are frequent over a reasonably large area (e.g. \i\f1 Mentha \'d7 verticillata) \i0\f0 are described and keyed as for species. Other common hybrids may be mentioned individually in notes (e.g. in\i  Euphrasia), or \i0 collectively for the whole genus (e.g. in \i Armeria\i0 ).\i 
\par  \i0 We have attempted to include the following categories of \i alien species\i0 :\i  
\par \i0 (i) Aliens which are effectively naturalized. These include garden plants which have escaped to situations not immediately adjacent to those in which they are cultivated, as well as weeds and other plants which have been accidentally introduced; provided, in both cases, that the plant has been established in a single station for at least 25 years, or is reported as naturalized in a number of widely separated localities. 
\par (ii) Trees or crop-plants which are planted or cultivated in continuous stands on a fairly extensive scale.

\par The genera \i Taraxacum\b  \b0\i0 and \i Hieracium\b  \b0\i0 have presented special problems in this volume, because they contain many apomictic species. As has been our practice in previous volumes, we have dealt with them in a pragmatic way. Complete accounts listing and describing all the named species, even if practicable, would have taken up too much space. What we have done is to provide a concise summary, indicating where further information can be sought. Thus in\b\i  \b0 Taraxacum\i0  4\b\i  \b0\i0 species and 26 groups have been described and keyed. Under each group, a selection of its more widespread species is listed, with geographical distribution, and in each group (except the \i T. officinale\b  \b0\i0 group) all the species described from Europe are indexed. \i Hieracium\b  \b0\i0 is rather more complex, because of its two subgenera \i Pilosella\b  \b0\i0 and \i Hieracium\b  \b0\i0 which behave in rather different ways, e.g. with respect to hybridization, but here again a uniform treatment, along the lines indicated for\i  Taraxacum\b , \b0\i0 has been worked out.
\par Only those few \i hybrids\b  \b0\i0 which are frequent over a reasonably large area (e.g. \i Galium\b  \b0\i0\f1\'d7 \i\f0 pomeranicum)\b  \b0\i0 are described and keyed as for species. Other common hybrids may be mentioned individually in notes (e.g. in \i Cirsium\i0 )\b\i  \b0\i0 or collectively for the whole genus (e.g.\b ).\b0  in\i  Achillea\i0 ).
\par We have attempted to include the following categories of\i  alien species\i0 :\i  
\par \i0 (i) Aliens\b  \b0 which are effectively naturalized. These include garden plants which have escaped\b  \b0 to situations not immediately adjacent to those in which they are cultivated, as well as weeds and other plants which have been accidentally introduced; provided, in both cases, that the plant has been established in a single station for at least 25 years, or is reported as naturalized in a number of widely separated localities.

\par All available evidence, morphological, geographical, ecological and cytogenetical, has been taken into consideration in delimiting species and subspecies, but they are in all cases definable in morphological terms. (Taxa below the rank of subspecies are not nomally included.) The delimitation of genera is often controversial and the solution adopted in the Flora may be a somewhat arbitrary choice between conflicting opinions. We have endeavoured to weigh as fairly as possible the various opinions available, but there has been no consistent policy of 'lumping' or 'splitting' genera (or, for that matter, species). The order and circumscription of the families is, with few small exceptions, that of\b  \b0 Melchior in\b  \b0 Engler,\b  \b0\i Syllabus der Pflanzenfamilien ed. \i0 12\b  (\b0 1964\b ).
\par \b0 All descriptions of taxa refer only to their representatives in Europe. In practice, we have relaxed this rule slightly for families and genera to avoid giving taxonomically misleading information, particularly in those cases where a large family or genus has only one or few, somewhat atypical, members in Europe. In such cases we have occasionally added 'in European members' or a similar phrase to emphasize the atypical representation. It should, however, never be assumed that the description is valid for all non-European taxa.
\par For the purpose of this Flora, we have tried as far as possible to interpret Europe in its traditional sense. The area covered is shown on the maps at the end of the volume.
\par \i Place-names \i0 used in the summaries of geographical distribution have been given in their English form when they refer to independent states (including the constituent republics of the U.S.S.R.) or to such geographical features of Europe as transcend national boundaries. All other place-names are given in the language of the country concerned. Thus we write \i Sweden, Ukraine, Danube, Alps, Mediterranean \i0 but \i Corse, Kriti, Slovenija, Rodopi Planina, Ahvenanmaa.\i0 
\par In\i  transliteration\i0  from\i  \i0 Cyrillic characters we have followed the ISO system recommended in the UNESCO \i Bulletin for Libraries\b  \i0 10\b0 : 136-137 (1956) for place-names and titles of journals. With personal names, however, we have followed the list of transliterations given in the index-volume (1962) to \i Not. Syst. (Leningrad), \i0 and have transliterated personal names which do not occur in this list according to the conventions used there.
\par In\b\i  \b0\i0 transliterating place-names from Greek characters, we have, except for omitting the accents, followed \i The Times Atlas of the World\i0 , Mid-Century Edition, vol. 4 (London, 1956).
\par On pp. xxv-xxvii, we give a list of \i Basic and Standard Floras. \i0 Basic Floras have been chosen as widely known Floras covering large or important parts of Europe. Standard Floras are considered to represent those Floras in current use and likely to be familiar to a large number of people in the particular country concerned; the list has been revised since the publication of Volume 4. There are, of course, a number of other useful Floras which do not, for one reason or another, appear in our list; the list, however, attempts to include those which are widely consulted and which have, therefore, been used as the main source of synonyms cited in \i Flora Europaea.\i0 
\par \i Synonyms,\i0  whether full or partial, are given in parentheses in the text only when they are used in one of the Basic Floras or when they are necessary to prevent confusion. (For primarily Iberian and Mediterranean species, synonyms used in the \i Prodromus\i0  of Willkomm & Lange, and the \i Supplementum\i0  by Willkomm (p. xxvii) are also included.) Synonyms (or the basionym) are also usually given in the text when the combination has not previously been used in a Flora or monograph, or when the nomenclature is otherwise unfamiliar or in need of explanation. Otherwise, synonyms are given in the Index only; but it is important to note that no attempt has been made to give a complete synonymy. Even at\b  \b0 the binomial level, the number of names for European plants is four or five times the number of accepted species, and to include all these would be impracticable. Thus, in addition to the binomials in the text, the Index contains all synonyms at specific rank which are used in the Basic and Standard Floras, or in cited monographs, with an indication of the species in the text under which they have been relegated to synonymy. Some subspecific names also appear in the Index. In this way, we hope that users of any Basic or Standard Flora will be able to relate the names used in their own Floras to those in \i Flora Europaea\i0 . In cases where the name of a familiar species has been changed, an explanation of this is usually published as a Notula (see p. xxiv).\i 
\par Citations \i0 have been abbreviated, and the abbreviations used for authors and places of publication have been standardized; lists of these abbreviations are given in Appendices I, II\i  \i0 and III. These lists apply only to the abbreviations used in Volume 5.
\par \i Species descriptions\i0\f1  attempt to give, within the limits of length set by the Flora, both the diagnostic characters of the plant and a general idea of its appearance. Where dimensions are given, a measurement without qualification refers to length. Two measurements connected by \'d7 indicate length followed by width. Further measurements in parentheses indicate exceptional sizes outside the normal ranges. In order to save space and facilitate identification, descriptions may sometimes take the form of a comparison with another\f0  description. The conventional way of setting this out is, to give an example (p. 77):
\par \pard\fi2125\b 6. Leucojum valentinum\b0  Pau....Like \b 5\b0  but....
\par \pard\fi275 This implies that the description with which it is being compared (in this example \b 5.\b0  \b Leucojum nicaeense\b0  Ardoino) applies to this taxon but for the\b  \b0 differences noted. It does not necessarily mean that the two taxa are similar in general appearance. Additional descriptive information is sometimes also given, but in separate sentences.
\par The\i  diploid chromosome number\i0  (2\i n\i0  = ) is given where it has been possible to verify that the count was made on material of known wild European origin. For naturalized and cultivated species, the count is from material which is naturalized or is cultivated in the way which justifies its inclusion in the Flora. It is hoped to publish separately a list of references to the data on which the published numbers are based.
\par \i Ecological information\i0  is given sparingly, and only where the ecological characteristics of a species are clearly and concisely definable for its total European range. Sometimes a general statement, applicable to a whole genus or to a group of species, is made. There is an inevitable irregularity of treatment, as in a great many cases reliable ecological information is not available. 
\par The description of each species is followed by an indication of its\i  distribution within\i0  \i Europe\i0 . This falls into two parts: (1) a summary in a short phrase; (2) a list of abbreviations of 'territories' in which the species occurs. The summary phrase makes use of everyday geographical phrases and concepts such as 'W. Europe','the Mediterranean region', 'the Balkan peninsula', etc. Maps IV and V and the legends accompanying them indicate the interpretation which is to be put on these phrases. We would emphasize that they are to be interpreted in a simple geographical sense, and do not attempt in any way to divide Europe phytogeographically.
\par \f1 Species believed to be endemic to Europe are distinguished by a symbol (\bullet ) before the summary of geographical distribution.\f0 
\par \pard\fi285 A more precise indication of distribution is given by the enumeration of the 'territories' (indicated by two-letter abbreviations) in which the plant occurs. The limits of these territories follow, with very few exceptions, existing political boundaries (see Map I). The territories, of course, vary greatly in size, and Ga, Hs or Ju gives very much less information than does Fa, Rs(K) or Tu. In all cases, however, the lists provide a guide to which national Floras should be searched for further detailed information, whether on taxonomy or on distribution. Occasionally, the fist of territories is followed by a brief indication, in parentheses, of extra-European distribution. This is done only for plants of which the European range is but a small fraction of the total and for species not native in Europe.
\par We have been greatly assisted in our preparation of the accounts of the Gramineae, Cyperaceae, and a few smaller families by the publication, before this volume went to press, of the first two parts of the \i Flora Partis Europaeae URSS, \i0 under the editorship of An. A. Fedorov, and we hope that at least for these families the accuracy of our information on the taxonomy and distribution of Russian plants has been improved. It is necessary, however to draw attention to the fact that the geographical subdivisions of the USSR used by Fedorov, although modelled on those used in \i Flora Europaea, \i0 do\i  \i0 not exactly correspond. This is because Fedorov has (very sensibly) defined his areas mainly in terms of administrative boundaries, whereas we have been compelled, in order to maintain consistency with our earlier volumes, to adhere to the rather imprecisely drawn ecological boundaries put forward by Komarov in 1934. The three most important areas of divergence are in N.W. Ukraine, S. Ural, and the region north-east of Leningrad. These are included by Fedorov in his western (Zapad), eastern (Vostok) and northem (Sever) divisions respectively, whereas for us they are all included in Rs(C). Our divergences, therefore, from Fedorov's distributional data, though they sometimes arise from a difference of opinion on the status of a species (native, introduced or casual), are more often due simply to the use of slightly different geographical units.
\par In general the only infraspecific taxa described and keyed in the Flora are subspecies. Any formal treatment of variation below the level of subspecies would have been impossible in a Flora of this kind; the known variation of taxa is, however, covered in the descriptions. No 'experimental' categories, such as ecotypes, are used in the Flora in a formal systematic sense, though they are sometimes mentioned in notes.
\par Where it is difficult to distinguish between a number of closely similar species in a genus, an \i ad hoc \i0 'group' has been made, and these groups, not the individual species, are keyed out in the main species key. They will serve for at least a partial identification. Following the description of a group in the text, a key to the component species is given, and they are then numbered and described, so that a more detailed study, or the availability of more adequate material, may enable the user to take the\b  \b0 identification further. For example, in \i Carex\i0  there is the\i  C. flava\i0  group, which comprises the species \i C. flava\i0  L., \i C. lepidocarpa\i0  Tausch, \i C.\i0  \i jemtlandica\i0  (Palmgren) Palmgren, \i C. nevadensis\i0   Boiss. & Reuter,\i  C. bergrothii\i0  Palmgren, \i C. demissa\i0  Hornem. and \i C. serotina\i0\f1  M\'e9rat. Such groups have no nomenclatural status.\f0 
\par Only those few \i hybrids\i0  which are frequent over a reasonably large area (e.g. \i Narcissus\i0\f1  \'d7 \i\f0 medioluteus \i0 Miller) are described and keyed as for species. Other fairly common hybrids may be mentioned individually in notes (e.g. in\i  Alisma\i0 ) or collectively for the whole genus (e.g. in Dactylorhiza). We have attempted to include the following categories of \i alien species\i0 :
\par  (i) Aliens which are effectively naturalized. These include garden plants which have escaped to situations not immediately adjacent to those in which they are cultivated, as well as weeds and other plants which have been accidentally introduced; provided, in both cases, that the plant has been established in a single station for at least 25 years, or is reported as naturalized in a number of widely separated localities.
\par (ii) Trees or crop-plants which are planted or cultivated in continuous stands on a fairly extensive scale.
\par Casual aliens, i.e. those which do not persist without repeated re-introduction, are not included unless they have often been mistaken for a native or established species, or are for any other reason of special interest. In assessing the status of a species in any part of Europe we have, however, been dependent very largely on the information contained in the national Floras, and it is clear that the criteria used by different authors vary widely. All data on native, naturalized or casual status relating to synanthropic plants must, therefore, be regarded as only approximate; in particular, we have found it very difficult to distinguish casual from naturalized status in the numerous tropical and subtropical grasses which have been introduced to the Mediterranean region.
\par It is the policy of the Committee not to publish new names in the Flora itself. To deal with the publication of much of this material, an arrangement has been made with our sponsor the Linnean Society of London, by which taxonomic and nomenclatural notes are being published as part of a series entitled \i Notulae Systematicae ad Floram Europaeam spectantes\i0  in the \i Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society\i0 . The \i Notulae\i0  corresponding to Volumes 1 and 2 were published in \i Feddes Repertorium\i0 .

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\qc\lang2055\b\f0\fs24 PREFACE TO VOLUME 1 (\b0\fs28 1st ed.\b )
\par \pard\b0\fs24 
\par \fs28 Europe, where scientific taxonomy was developed, and whose taxonomists have participated, for more than a century, in the preparation of Floras for other continents, does not possess a Flora of its own. Many hundreds of national and regional Floras exist, together covering almost every part of Europe, but there is no modern work which deals with the area as a whole.
\par       There are obvious historical and political reasons which explain the lack of such a Flora. It is, however, becoming increasingly important, as in all other fields of science, that a work synthesizing the accumulated data from the various regions should be produced. For one thing, the channels of distribution of information are being choked by the accumulation of unassimilated or neglected data and if these channels can be cleared, and the data sifted, collected and arranged, botanical science will be stimulated. Equally important, good taxonomy is the basis for many kinds of scientific research, but this taxonomy must be broadly based and well considered and must transcend national boundaries. To the biosystematist and the phytogeographer, for example, local taxonomy can be misleading, whereas a wider treatment, on a continental scale, can correct misconceptions and reveal problems that had not been previously suspected. A new, synthetic Flora of Europe will be useful, not only to specialists, but also tobiologists of many kinds. It should make it easier for them to give a plant an accurate name, which we regard as one of the primary aims of a Flora, and it should also direct their attention to literature in which further information can be found. 
\par       The problems which face those attempting to write a Flora of Europe are formidable. The materials available are of various kinds: there are some outdated catalogues of European plants (such as Nyman's \i Conspectus Florae Europaeae\i0 ), some important regional Floras, such as those by Hegi and Komarov, and many excellent national Floras. In addition, there is a vast accumulation of literature, published in many places and in a variety of languages, much of which is relatively inaccessible and virtually unknown outside its country of origin. The writers of a European Flora must be prepared to seek out this literature and review it critically, in addition to studying for themselves in the herbarium and the field the plants about which they propose to write.
\par        This, then, is the background against which any decision to write a Flora of Europe has to be taken. Mention must be made of the \i Flora Europaea \i0 projected by Werner Rothmaler in the 1940s which was to cover not only Europe but also the Caucasus, Transjordan and parts of North Africa. Owing to the conditions of wartime this scheme was abandoned. The question was reopened in a discussion on 'Progress of Work in the European Flora' at a session of the 8th International Botanical Congress held at Paris in 1954.Although no formal decision to write a Flora was taken, further discussions between a number of European botanists followed, and eventually an informal committee came into being, which held its first meeting at Leicester in January 1956. This committee (the constitution of which is given in "The Flora Europaea Organization"), has remained in being, and, with few modifications, has become the executive committee in charge of the project. It was realized from the start that, while it was obviously advantageous to have a central organization in one part of Europe (the British Isles), the project could only succeed with continuous and substantial advice and help from every part of Europe. Accordingly, invitations to a number of distinguished European botanists to act as Advisory Editors were issued; the prompt acceptance of these invitations and the approval and support received encouraged the committee to proceed.
\par      The next step was to plan the Flora in detail. As a result of much discussion a booklet entitled \i The Presentation of Taxonomic Information: A Short Guide for Contributors to Flora Europaea\i0  was prepared and published in 1958, and it then became possible to begin the writing of the Flora. Editors for each family were appointed from the Editorial Committee, and accounts of individual families or genera were obtained from botanists in all parts of Europe. The list of contributors to volume I is given. Details of the style and form of the Flora are given below.
\par       It should be emphasized that it has been, and remains, the intention of the Editorial Committee to produce a concise and complete Flora in the shortest possible time. Consequently, the principle has been adopted that publication of the Flora cannot be delayed for an indefinite period to allow the lengthy and detailed research required for a complete solution of all the problems that arise during its preparation. The committee believes that it is more valuable to have a complete Flora, representing a synthesis of available information, than a series of detailed monographs where completion could not be foreseen. It is planned to complete the Flora in four volumes over the next eight years.
\par         It is important to emphasize that full collaboration with taxonomists in every part of Europe has been sought and obtained at every stage during the writing of the Flora. A panel of Regional Advisers was organized (the full list is given above). All manuscripts were circulated tothese Advisers, and their comments on them, based on their specialized knowledge of both taxonomy and local distributions, have been invaluable and constitute an integral part of the organization of the Flora.
\par         Arising out of the contacts established in this way, Symposia have been held, at Vienna in 1959, and at Genoa in 1961, to which all the Advisers of the Flora were invited, and at which topics of common interest were discussed. These Symposia have been important in establishing international collaboration on a firm basis, and in making it possible to plan the future progress of the Flora with confidence. A further Symposium was held in 1963 in Romania.
\par          The names of the authors primarily responsible for writing the accounts of the various families and genera are given in the text. In preparing the first volume of the Flora for the press, much trouble has been taken by the editors to produce a self-consistent manuscript, in a fairly standardized form, incorporating such revision and alteration of taxonomy ,nomenclature and distribution as has been necessary. It should therefore bemade clear that the Editorial Committee takes full responsibility for the form in which the text is published.
\par           Acknowledgement is made below to the many people and organizations who have given help, financial and otherwise, in the preparation of the Flora. We should, however, record here our special gratitude to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in London which, by granting the Committee large sums of money over a period of several years, has made it possible to set up and maintain a permanent secretariat at the University of Liverpool, and to undertake the many ancillary activities which have arisen. It is in the prospect of their continuing support that we are now proceeding with the second volume.

\par Maps IV and V are intended merely to give precision to certain geographical phrases which are commonly used, but used in various senses in different parts of Europe. They do not purport to divide Europe into phyto-geographical regions, as is apparent from the fact that along parts of their boundaries these regions overlap, and along other parts they are not contiguous.
\par 
\par Certain other phrases used in the summaries of geographical distribution, but not illustrated in the maps, may be briefly defined as follows:
\par \i Alps\i0\f1 : Separated from the Appennini at 8\'b015' E. (above Savona); bounded on the east by the line Semmering\emdash Graz\emdash Maribor\emdash Ljubljana\emdash Trieste. Divided into three major divisions: eastern, central, and south-western, by the lines Arlberg\emdash St Moritz\emdash Chiavenna\emdash Como and Gen\'e8ve\emdash Chamonix\emdash Aosta\emdash Ivrea.\f0 
\par \i Arctic\i0 : This term is used to designate all territories north of the Arctic Circle, and is not restricted to those which have only 'arctic' vegetation.
\par \i Extreme north\i0\f1 : Arctic Europe, together with Iceland, and Fennoscandia and Russia northwards from approximately 64\'b0 N.\f0 
\par \i Carpathians\i0 : Divided into \i western\i0 ,\i  eastern\i0  and \i southern\i0\f1  divisions at the pass of Lupk\'f3w (22\'b0 E.) and the Oituz Pass (46\'b0 05' N.). The western division is in Czechoslovakia and Poland, the southern entirely in Romania, the eastern extends from Czechoslovakia and Poland through Ukraine to Romania.\f0 
\par \i Pyrenees\i0\f1 : Includes the subsidiary chains within 50 km of the main watershed, and extends westwards to Bilbao and Vitoria. Divided into eastern, central and western divisions at the Pont du Roi (0\'b0 45' E.) and the Col du Somport (0\'b0 30' W.).\i\f0 Balkan peninsula\i0\f1 : Jugoslavia south of the Danube\emdash Sava\emdash Kupa line, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece (including islands close to the mainland) and Turkey-in-Europe.\f0 
\par \i Fennoscandia\i0 : Norway, Sweden, Finland and part of N.W. Russia (Murmanskaja Oblast' and Karelskaja A.S.S.R.).
\par \i Mediterranean region\i0 : All European territories within 100 km of the Mediterranean Sea (including the Adriatic, but not the Black Sea), and including also all Italy except the Alpine region and all Spain except the west and north-west. It is divided into\i  eastern\i0  and \i western\i0  divisions by a line following the main watershed of Italy and running east of Sicilia. \i Central Mediterranean\i0\f1  indicates the region between 8\'b0 E. and 20\'b0 E.\f0 
\par \i Aegean region\i0 : All islands in the Aegean Sea which come within the scope of the\i  Flora\i0 , and those parts of Greece and Turkey-in-Europe which drain into the Aegean Sea or the Dardanelles.
\par \i Macedonia\i0 : Comprises the Jugoslav republic of Makedonija, the Greek province of Makedhonia, and the Bulgarian province of Blagoevgrad.

\par 
\par The Flora Europaea project received in its early stages several valuable \i ad hoc \i0 grants without which no substantial progress could have been made; these were from the Royal Society, the Botanical Research Fund, the Royal Horticultural Society, and Miss M. S. Campbell. A loan from Mr and Mrs J. E. Raven tided the Committee over a difficult period. In 1959 a successful application was made by the Organizing Committee to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research for a three-year grant which has now been extended for a further three years. The total amount of the grant for t\f1 he period 1959-1965 is \'a332,000. This has permitted adequate finance of the Secretariat and its services, and the appointment of a number of full-time Research Assistants: Miss A. B. Mowat (1959-1960), Dr P. W. Ball (1959-) and Mr A. O. Chater (1960-). Dr Ball previously held a Leverhulme Research Fellowship at the University of Liverpool to work on the project. The Committee gratefully acknowledges all this generous support.\f0 
\par \pard\fi175\sa75\sl275\slmult0 In addition to this main grant from British sources, the project received direct and indirect financial help from several countries, among which should be mentioned a grant for secretarial printing from the Instituto de Alta Cultura, Lisbon, and grants from the Ministries of Education in Austria and Italy, and from the International Union of Biological Sciences, towards the Symposia held in Vienna and Genoa. The third Symposium which was held in Romania was generously subsidized by the Academy of the Romanian People's Republic. We gratefully acknowledge the sponsorship of our project by the Linnean Society of London.
\par Acknowledgement is also due to the Universities of Cambridge, Dublin, Durham, Leicester and Liverpool for their support in making facilities available to the members of the Editorial Committee and their assistants. In particular the University of Liverpool has provided accommodation in the Hartley Botanical Laboratories for the Secretariat since 1957.
\par We are also grateful to the Directors of the various Museums and Herbaria who have provided the Editorial Committee and Regional Advisers with facilities to study their collections and utilize their libraries. Amongst these must be mentioned the Herbarium and Library, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; the Department of Botany, British Museum (Natural History), London; the Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna; and the Herbarium of the Istituto Botanico, Florence. The Trinity College Dublin Trust has made a substantial grant towards the provision of microfilm and a reader.
\par \f1 A very large number of individual botanists have assisted us in various ways. The following deserve special mention: P. Aellen (Basel), Miss P. Edwards (London), A. Hansen (K\'f8benhavn), E.K. Horwood (Leicester), A.C. Jermy (London), N.Y. Sandwith (Kew). P.D.  Sell (Cambridge), as well as assisting in several other ways, undertook the laborious task of preparing the index for the press.\f0 
\par \pard\fi175\sa275\sl275\slmult0 The staff of the Secretariat, Mrs R. Seddon, Mrs J. Beck and Mrs T. Donnelly, deserve our special gratitude for their great efficiency and loyalty even during times of almost overwhelming pressure.

\par 
\par \pard\sa95\sl275\slmult0\f1 The Editorial Committee gratefully acknowledges the support of the Linnean Society of London, whose Flora Europaea Trust Fund provided \'a3120,000 towards the cost of revising this volume. It has financed the employment of two full-time Research Officers, J.R. Akeroyd (1983-1988) and M.E. Newton (1990-), and has met other expenses of the Secretariat. This was helped over a difficult period by a loan from the Royal Society's scientific publications fund. Financial assistance in the form of a legacy from the\f0  estate of the late Miss M.S. Campbell is also greatly appreciated, having provided an opportunity to commission illustrations for a new series of Notulae.
\par \pard\fi175\sa75\sl275\slmult0 In undertaking the revision of Volume 1 of \i Flora Europaea \i0 the Committee has enjoyed continued assistance and encouragement from many colleagues throughout Europe. We wish to thank them for their willing and generous co-operation. Their help has been given in many ways, some of them botanical and others technical, but all of them vital to the success of our project.
\par We are deeply appreciative of the assistance of R.R. Mill, who compiled and checked the Appendices, and Mrs L. Walters, who transferred synonymy to the text and drew up the index. Our special thanks are due to Mrs M. Hart for typing the manuscript so diligently.
\par \pard In addition to the authors of individual accounts, we have received advice on particular groups from many people: J. Cullen \i (Alyssum, Aurinia), \i0 C.R.Fraser-Jenkins \i (Polypodium), \i0 H.Freitag (Chenopodiaceae), I.C. Hedge (Chenopodiaceae), M.V. Kasakova \i (Schivereckia), \i0 R.D. Meikle (Salicaceae), C.N. Page \i (Equisetum), \i0 J.R. Press (Rumex, Subgen. \i Platypodium), \i0 C.D. Preston (Aizoaceae), K.H. Rechinger (Rumex), T.C.G. Rich (Cruciferae), L.-P. Ronse Decraene \i (Polygonum), \i0 F. Rose \i (Salicornia), \i0 G.D. Rowley (Aizoaceae, Crassulaceae), D. Tzanoudakis \i (Paeonia), \i0 P. Uotila \i (Chenopodium) \i0 and S.D. Webster \i (Ranunculus, \i0 Subgen. \i Batrachium). \i0 P\i .\i0 W. Ball, as well as editing Cruciferae, critically read many of the manuscripts, and A.C. Jermy and Miss A.M. Paul carefully checked Pteridophyta.
\par \pard\fi175\sa75\sl275\slmult0 More general comment and advice for which we are grateful was received from: H.J.M. Bowen, R.K. Brummitt, G. Buzas, E.J. Clement, D.V. Geltman, A. Hansen, J. Jalas, C.E. Jarvis, S.L. Jury, D.H. Kent, Miss C. Leon, Mrs B. Molesworth Allen, D. Nicolson, Miss E. Powell, R.W. Rutherford, P.D. Sell, C.A. Stace, J. Suominen and M.F. Watson. The Editorial Committee is also most grateful to members of the Committee for Mapping the Flora of Europe for their generosity in allowing us to consult unpublished typescripts from the \i Atlas Florae Europaeae \i0 project.
\par \pard\fi175\sa275\sl275\slmult0 The Committee acknowledges a debt of gratitude to the Directors of many Museums and Herbaria. We thank them all but wish particularly to mention the University of Cambridge ; Trinity College, Dublin; the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh; the National Museums & Galleries on Merseyside, Liverpool; the Natural History Museum, London; and the University of Reading, the institutions whose facilities we have enjoyed for the greater part of our work.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\qc\lang2055\ul\b\f0\fs24 The Electronic Flora Europaea
\par 
\par \pard\ulnone\b0\fs28 
\par When the preparation of \i Flora Europaea\i0  began in the 1950s, no-one could have envisaged the dramatic developments in information technology and their application to floristic projects of this nature. It is, therefore, with great pleasure that we welcome the publication of this electronic version of \i Flora Europaea\i0 . Even today, the number of Floras that are available as CD Roms is still very small and we are sure that this will be widely welcomed as a tool that is in tune with the age. Dr S. Jorna (assisted by Dr C. Muir) is to be congratulated on his careful scanning and setting up of the five volumes of text that made the issue of this CD Rom of \i Flora Europaea\i0  possible.\i  
\par 
\par \i0 The completion of \i Flora Europaea\i0 , 20 years ago, was a landmark. Not only did it give Europe a consensus Flora for the whole continent and provide a nomenclatural standard, but it served as an inspiration and model for Flora writers in other continents. 
\par 
\par It had been predicted that the publication of \i Flora Europaea\i0  would de detrimental to plant taxonomy, but the opposite has been the case. It lead to a remarkable resurgence of activity in the systematics of European plants, with large numbers of new taxa described and numerous taxonomic treatments published, including regional, national and local Floras and revisions of individual genera and species groups. This has been particularly true for southern Europe where major Flora projects are now particularly active in areas of high plant diversity: the Iberian Peninsula and Greece. 
\par 
\par The skilful management of the royalties, paid into a Trust Fund administered by the Linnean Society of London, enabled the \i Flora Europaea \i0\f1 Editorial Committee to appoint Dr J. R. Akeroyd to undertake a revision of volume one under the direction of the Editorial Committee. The revised volume contains some 10% more numbered species than the original and the 350-odd species mentioned in \lquote observations\rquote  in the first edition have been either enumerated or reduced to synonymy, although further species in \lquote observations\rquote  have been added. \f0 
\par 
\par The Editorial Committee decided that it would not be feasible or desirable to continue to revise volumes 2-5 in this way and this has meant that no more revisions have been undertaken or are planned for \i Flora Europaea.\i0\f1  Following this decision, the Editorial Committee decided to disband and created \lquote The \i\f0 Flora Europaea \i0\f1 Residuary Body\rquote  to deal with any matters arising out of the publication of Flora Europaea, such as this CD Rom.\f0 
\par 
\par Recently,. an organization called Euro+Med PlantBase has been established to create a modern electronic Euro-Mediterranean plant information system and database (Project Sisyphus), that aims to produce a new plant checklist for Europe and provide revised taxonomic treatments for all of Europe, the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea and Macaronesia. It aims to restore the taxonomic consensus once established by \i Flora Europaea. \i0 The Linnean Society of London is again a sponsor of this project as is the Organisation for the Phyto-Taxonomic Investigation of the Mediterranean Area (OPTIMA). A grant from the European Union under Framework 5 has recently been obtained for the initial phase of this project whose Secretariat is based at the University of Reading.
\par 
\par An earlier electronic version of \i Flora Europaea, \i0 excluding the descriptions, was prepared under the direction of one of us (VHH) at Reading. This database became known as the European Science Foundation European Documentation System (ESFEDS) and this has been further developed at the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh by Dr R. J. Pankhurst. The ESFEDS database provides the main starting point for the Euro+Med PlantBase project. It will thus build on the strengths and underlying philosophy of \i Flora Europaea\i0 .

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\qc\lang2055\f0\fs24 PREFACE TO VOLUME 1 (\fs28 2nd ed\b .)
\par \pard\b0 
\par On 4 September 1977, a meeting was held in Cambridge of many of those associated with the \i Flora Europaea\i0  project to mark the completion of the work and to hand formally to the Cambridge University Press the manuscript of the final volume. During this meeting there were discussions on the need for revisions, for corrigenda and addenda, for a possible second edition and on the future of the Flora Europaea Organization as a whole. There was a strong feeling, particularly amongst our continental colleagues, that some way of continuing the links which had been built up through the Flora Europaea Organization, should be maintained. It was generally agreed that neither the Editorial Committee nor the Flora Europaea Organization should be disbanded but, for the time being, would go into abeyance.
\par      After the proofs of Volume 5 had been checked and the other responsibilities completed, the Editorial Committee arranged for the papers associated with the Flora Europaea Organization and with the preparation of the manuscripts to be deposited in the Library of the University of Reading under the care of the University Archivist. Arrangements had already been made for the royalties from the sale of the volumes of \i Flora Europaea\i0  and associated publications to be paid into a special Trust Fund administered by the Linnean Society of London. The Editorial Committee would like to record its thanks to the Linnean Society for so ably administering the Trust Fund and for the continuing support which the Society has given in so many ways.
\par       Since Volume 5 was published, many informal discussions have taken place between members of the Editorial Committee regarding the production of indices and taxonomic publications closely associated with \i Flora Europaea\i0  and, particularly, about the continually accumulating addenda and corrigenda, which were being assembled by Professors Heywood and Moore at the University of Reading. In October 1981, the Editorial Committee reassembled on a formal basis and has continued to meet at regular intervals. There was a general feeling among the members of the Committee that, if any revision were to be attempted, it would be particularly necessary for Volume 1. This was, in part, because it was the most out of date, but also because the Committee believed it to contain more errors than did later volumes. Many of these arose from the fact that the technique of making the critical synthesis, at which the Flora aimed, took some time to learn, and also from the necessity of meeting an acceptable time-schedule, which meant that some parts of the volume were written or edited in more haste than the Editorial Committee would have wished.
\par       At a meeting in June 1983, the Editorial Committee discussed detailed papers prepared by members of the Committee on proposals for the revision of Volume 1. It was agreed that the Committee should undertake the responsibility itself and an outline of the procedures to be followed was agreed. The accumulated royalties in the Flora Europaea Trust Fund made it possible for the Committee to appoint an experienced full-time research worker to carry out the revision under the direction of the Committee. Dr J. R. Akeroyd was appointed, taking up his duties on 1 October 1983. His previous experience with the taxonomy and evolution of British and Mediterranean plants was, in the view of the Editorial Committee, particularly appropriate. Later, a further appointment was made, and Dr M. E. Newton began work on the Flora in February 1990. Since the publication of Volume 5, Mr A. O. Chater of the Natural History Museum, London, and Dr J. R. Edmondson of the National Museums & Galleries on Merseyside, Liverpo\f1 ol, have joined the Editorial Committee. It was with great regret that the members of the Organization learnt of the deaths of Professor D. H. Valentine on 10 April 1987 and Professor T. G. Tutin, F.R.S. on 7 October 1987. These colleagues both played major r\'f4les in the inception, development and subsequent successful conclusion of the Flora Europaea project.\f0 
\par        Following the death of Professor Tutin, Dr N.A. Burges was appointed Chairman of the Committee, whilst Professor V.H. Heywood, who had so very ably carried out the duties of Secretary since the formation of the Committee in January 1956, was succeeded by Professor D. M. Moore in November 1986 and he, in October 1989, by Dr J. R. Edmondson. Professors Heywood and Moore both remain as members of the Committee.
\par       With the limited resources available it was impossible to continue the formal continent-wide consultation and the circulation of manuscripts in various stages of completion, valued almost as much by our European colleagues as by ourselves in the preparation of the first edition. However, many colleagues throughout Europe have significantly assisted in the revision of this volume. Throughout the revision, the Committee for Mapping the Flora of Europe, in Helsinki, has also made available a great deal of manuscript information which has proved invaluable.
\par       Virtually every genus has been critically examined, and the accounts of most genera have been substantially revised. The relative amount of work undertaken by the authors involved in the revisions varies greatly and it has not been easy to indicate this succinctly in the text. The compromise decided on by the Editorial Committee has been to limit the attribution of authorship to three categories: (i) where the original author is deceased, inaccessible or did not wish to be associated with the revised account, the account is shown as 'original author (edition 1 ) revised by new contributor (edition 2) '; (ii) where a major revision has been undertaken by a new contributor with the approval of the original author, it is shown as 'original author revised by new contributor'; and (iii) where the revision has been made in collaboration with the original author, the names of both contributors are given with no reference to edition.
\par       The Editorial Committee realizes that the restriction to only three categories may lead to an over-simplification of the variation in the amount of work undertaken by different contributors, but it believes this is preferable to attempting to provide a more detailed quantitative assessment which would be difficult to do with any precision. There have been instances where the Editorial Committee has found it necessary to take firm editorial action to achieve the consistency of treatment which has been such a fundamental feature of \i Flora Europaea\i0  since its inception and which experience has shown has been valued by the users of the Flora. As throughout the Flora, the Editorial Committee accepts responsibility for the accounts as published.
\par        Since publication of the first edition of Volume 1 in 1964, some 250 species and 150 subspecies belonging to families in Volume 1 have been described from Europe as new to science. In addition to these, 25 species, known elsewhere, have been recorded as occurring as natives in Europe, while around 40 additional alien species have been reported as being naturalized in Europe. A critical assessment of these in accordance with the principles used throughout \i Flora Europaea\i0  has led us to include some 350 extra taxa in the new edition. At the same time, further information has enabled us to clarify many of the doubts raised in the first edition and has resulted in the deletion of about 20 taxa. Changes in taxonomy and nomenclature have been made only when there seemed to be general agreement as to their correctness by those who had studied the problem. When reasonable doubt remained, we thought it better to make no change. Although the main burden of the work in revising Volume 1 has fallen on Dr Akeroyd, the Editorial Committee has maintained a close supervision throughout.
\par        In the preparation of the second edition of Volume 1 we have attempted to meet one of the most widely voiced criticisms of the first edition; that text synonymy was too often inadequate, many synonyms being restricted to the index alone. All synonyms are now cited in the text.
\par        In the first edition, separate lists were given of what were regarded as Basic Floras and Standard Floras. The inclusion of synonyms in the text and the appearance of newer works has made the distinction no longer of value. Accordingly, there is now a single list of Standard Floras which gives an indication of the source of synonyms and of the most up-to-date Floras of the various areas covered by Europaea.
\par       The publication of a revised Volume 1 naturally raises the issue as to what revisions, if any, should be made of the other volumes. At the moment no decision has been taken but the matter is under active review by the Editorial Committee, the Secretariat of which is now based in the Department of Botany at Liverpool Museum, part of the National Museums & Galleries on Merseyside.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\qc\lang2055\b\f0\fs24 PREFACE TO VOLUME 2\b0\fs28 
\par \pard 
\par The development of the Flora Europaea project was outlined in the Preface to Volume 1, and it is not necessary to recapitulate it here. It is sufficient to remind the reader of the successful publication of Volume 1, and the fulfilment of the promise to proceed as quickly as possible with Volume 2. That it has been possible to produce it in less than four years is gratifying to the Editorial Committee, and is a tribute to the unstinted collaboration of our advisers and friends in every part of Europe. We must express our gratitude here to our advisory editors and regional advisers, both old and new. The tradition of biennial Symposia has been maintained with meetings in Denmark in 1965, and in Spain in 1967.
\par Since the publication of Volume 1; the Editorial Committee has been strengthened by the addition of Dr D. M. Moore; and Dr I. K. Ferguson has been appointed as a third research assistant.
\par We again record our deep gratitude to the United Kingdom Science Research Council, whose continuing financial support has made it possible to maintain our organization and secretariat, and also to appoint from 1966 the additional Research Assistant. We have also been able to invite, for periods of three months, a number of visiting bursars, who have worked at British Universities and research institutes. Each has prepared an account of a particular genus or group of species for Volume 3. Visitors to dat\f1 e have been Dr A. Jasiewicz (Krak\'f3w), Dr S. Kozuharov (Sofija) and Dr J. Holub (Pruhonice). The total amount of the Science Research Council grant for the period 1965-8 is \'a334,000.\f0 
\par In addition to this main grant, the project has received direct and indirect financial help from several countries, among which should be mentioned The Royal Society, London, the Danish Botanical Society and the Spanish Higher Council for Scientific Research. We gratefully acknowledge the continuing sponsorship of our project by the Linnean Society of London. A committee has been set up jointly by the Society and the Flora Europaea Organizing Committee to administer, in the interests of taxonomic research on the flora of Europe, a trust fund arising from the royalties from the Flora.
\par The British Museum (Natural History) has provided accommodation for Dr Ferguson; our special thanks are due to the Keeper of Botany and his staff for this and for many other favours. We are also grateful to the Director and Staff of the Herbarium and Library, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, for much help, willingly given ; and to institutions abroad, notably the Naturhistorisches Museum, Wien and the Komarov Botanical Institute of the Academy of Sciences, Leningrad. We should like to mention specially Mr J.E. Dandy, one of our Advisory Editors, who has played an increasingly important part as adviser on nomenclature. In addition, many botanists, not formally associated with our organization, have helped us in various ways, notably H. Runemark (Lund), S. Kozuharov (Sofija) and the late N.Y. Sandwith (Kew). P.D. Sell (Cambridge) undertook the laborious task of preparing the index for the press.
\par As in Volume 1, the names of the authors primarily responsible for writing the accounts of families and genera are given in footnotes to the text. It should, however, be made clear that the Editorial Committee takes full responsibility for the form in which the text is published. Acknowledgements are due to the Universities of Cambridge, Dublin, Durham, Leicester, Liverpool and Manchester for their support in making facilities available to members of the Editorial Committee and their assistants. In particular, the University of Liverpool has continued to provide accommodation in the Hartley Botanical Laboratories for the Secretariat. We should in conclusion express om gratitude to the staff of the Secretariat, Mrs J. Beck, Mrs M.E. Donnelly and Mrs M.L. Pollard for their continuing efficiency and loyalty.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\qc\lang2055\b\f0\fs24 PREFACE TO VOLUME 3\b0\fs28 
\par \pard 
\par The publication of Volume 3 of \i Flora Europaea\b  \b0\i0 marks another stage in the progress of this international cooperative venture. A work of this nature is the outcome of a vast fund of goodwill and collaboration which we have continued to enjoy from our friends and advisers throughout Europe.
\par It is a matter of great satisfaction to the Editorial Committee to see the many ways in which the previous two volumes of \i Flora Europaea\b  \b0\i0 have stimulated taxonomic and floristic research in many parts of Europe. Furthermore, the project has been a source of inspiration to botanists in other continents when contemplating the production of Floras of their own regions.
\par 
\par \f1 The United Kingdom Science Research Council has continued its generous financial support during the period of preparation of this volume and has enabled us to maintain our secretariat and staff as well as permitting us to invite a further number of visiting bursars, who have assisted us in preparing accounts. These visiting bursars have been Professor I.Dost\'e1l (Olomouc), Dr K. Werner (Halle), Dr Viera Fer\'e1kov\'e1 (Bratislava), Dr S.Snogerup (Lund), Professor L.Boulos (Cairo), Dr M.Kovanda (Praha), and Dr Delphine Cartier (Orsay). The total amount of the Science Research Council grant for the period 1968-72 is \'a336,560, and we wish to record our deep gratitude for this support.\f0 
\par 
\par \f1 The sixth Flora Europaea symposium was held in Switzerland and France in 1970, and we are grateful to Professors J. Mi\'e8ge (Gen\'e8ve), M. Guinochet (Orsay),J.-P. Barry (Nice) and their staff for the local organization of this highly successful meeting. Financial support was received from The Royal Society, the International Union of Biological Sciences, Hoffmann-La Roche & Cie S.A., B\'e2le, Zyma S.A., Nyon, Ciba S.A., B\'e2le, and Geigy S.A., B\'e2le. Publication in 1971 of the \i\f0 Actes du VI Symposium de Flora Europaea \i0 (as \i Boissiera \i0\f1 Volume 19), under the editorship of J. Mi\'e8ge and W. Greuter, was made possible by a grant from the Fonds National Suisse pour la R\'e9cherche Scientifique.\f0 
\par 
\par Although it was our original intention to publish the whole of the \i Sympetalae\i0  as a single volume, it became evident at an early stage of preparation that such a volume would run to some 1,000 pages and would be too large to handle conveniently either editorially or physically. Accordingly it was decided to spread the \i Sympetalae\i0  over two volumes, of which this is the first. Preparation of the other part (Volume 4) covering the Plantaginales and Campanulales is already well advanced.
\par The Editorial Committee has remained the same for Volume 3 as for Volume 2 but there have been changes in our team of Research Associates. Dr P. W. Ball left us in 1969 after having worked for \i Flora Europaea \i0 for\b\i  \b0\i0 more than ten years, during which he made many contributions to the Flora and assisted with editorial and secretarial matters. Dr I.K. Ferguson also resigned, in 1968, and was replaced by Mr I. B. K. Richardson the same year. Dr Ball's successor was Dr R. A. DeFilipps who joined us in 1969.
\par 
\par The Linnean Society of London have continued to act as our sponsor and have generously agreed to the publication of our series \i Notulae Systematicae ad Floram Europaeam spectantes in \i0 their Botanical Journal, following a decision to discontinue publication in \i Feddes Repertorium. \i0 Our thanks are due to the Keeper of Botany and Staff of the Department of Botany, British Museum (Natural History) for continuing to provide us and our collaborators with many facilities. We are also grateful to the Director and Staff of the Herbarium and Library, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, for similar assistance and advice. Other European institutions have assisted with the loan of material and given us hospitality during our visits, especially the Naturhistorisches Museum, Wien, the Conservatoire et \f1 Jardin botaniques, Gen\'e8ve, and the Istituto Botanico dell'Universit\'e0 di Firenze. To these and many other institutions we would like to express our thanks.\f0 
\par Once again Mr J.E. Dandy, one of our Advisory Editors, has performed a most valuable service in checking the nomenclature of the great majority of the manuscripts and given freely of his expert advice. As in the previous volumes Mr P. D. Sell (Cambridge) has prepared the index for the press and we are indebted to him for undertaking this complex and painstaking work.
\par The names of the authors primarily responsible for the accounts of families and genera are given in footnotes. The Editorial Committee accepts full responsibility for the text as published, which may in some cases have been substantially altered in form and presentation.
\par We wish to make acknowledgement to the Universities of Cambridge, Dublin, Leicester, Manchester, Reading and Ulster for kindly providing facilities for members of the Editorial Committee and their assistants. In 1968, following the acceptance of an appointment at the University of Reading by our Secretary, Professor V. H. Heywood, the Secretariat moved to Reading and is housed in the University Department of Botany.
\par Finally we wish to record our gratitude to the secretarial staff who play a key role in the production of the Flora. In Liverpool the team comprised Mrs Joan Beck, Mrs Margaret Donnelly, and Mrs Margaret Pollard. The staff at Reading are Mrs Rosa Husain and Mrs Linda Bennett. We greatly appreciate their devoted service.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\qc\lang2055\b\f0\fs24 PREFACE TO VOLUME 4
\par \b0\fs28 
\par \pard The publication of Volume 4 of \i Flora Europaea\b  \b0\i0 completes our account of the Dicotyledonous families, leaving a final fifth volume to cover the Monocotyledones. The present volume contains many genera of exceptional taxonomic difficulty and it is in no small measure due to the unfailing cooperation and advice we have received from our many friends and advisers who make up the \i Flora Europaea\b  \b0\i0 organization that we have been able to prepare it for publication within four years of the previous volume.
\par After a modest start nearly twenty years ago, the \i Flora Europaea\b  \b0\i0 organization is now a well-established feature of the botanical scene in Europe, and its significance has been widely appreciated in other continents. We are indebted to all our Regional Advisers and Advisory Editors for keeping faith with us year after year. To our authors we owe a special debt of gratitude for the way in which they have not only provided us with manuscripts but have accepted the very extensive modifications to which these have often been subjected during the various stages of editing. Problems of generic delimitation have been of special concern in some families in this volume and the willingness of our authors to accept, although not without extensive discussion and debate, proposals for the modification of their original generic disposition, in the interests of some degree of uniformity of treatment, has been testimony to their cooperation. As in the previous volumes, the Editorial Committee accepts full responsibility for the form in which the text appears.
\par Our team of Research Associates has remained unchanged during the preparation of this volume; Dr R. DeFilipps after five years' loyal service with us has now returned to the Smithsonian Institution, Washington.
\par \f1 There has been a major change in the pattern of financial support for the project during the past years. The United Kingdom Science Research Council has provided support continuously for the project since 1959 but its final grant expired in 1973. We wish to express our profound appreciation of this outstanding support, amounting to over \'a3130,000, which made the realization of the \i\f0 Flora Europaea\b  \b0\i0\f1 project possible. Since 1973 we have been fortunate in obtaining grants from European sources outside the United Kingdom. The contributing bodies have been Funda\'e7\'e3o Calouste Gulbenkian; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Italy; Fonds national de la recherche scientifique, Switzerland; Natural Science Research Council, Sweden; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Spain; Trinity College, University of Dublin, Ireland; Royal Irish Academy; National Science Council, Ireland; National Research Council, Denmark; National Research Council, Iceland; M. Roger de Vilmorin, France; Goulandris Botanical Museum, Greece; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, France. At the time of writing \'a322,475 has been received or promised from these bodies and we are grateful to them and to our Advisers who have been instrumental in negotiating the grants. In particular we wish to acknowledge the role of the Natural Science Research Council of Sweden which has coordinated the work of seeking contributions w\f0 ithin the West European Research Councils. A substantial grant has also been made by the \i Flora Europaea \i0 Trust Fund of the Linnean Society of London, which receives its income from the royalties from the Flora.
\par The seventh \i Flora\b  \b0 Europaea \i0 symposium was held in Coimbra in May 1972 and was arranged through the courtesy of Professor A. Fernandes. Financial support for this very successful meeting was provided by the Instituto de Alta Cultura, the Ministry of National Education, the Mayor of Coimbra and the Sociedade Broteriana.
\par We have continued to enjoy unfailing courtesy and assistance from the Keeper and Staff of the Department of Botany, British Museum (Natural History), London, and from the Director and Staff of the Herbarium and Library, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. We are also grateful to many other European institutions for their help in lending us material.
\par Once again we wish to acknowledge the exceedingly valuable contribution to the Flora made by Mr J.E.Dandy, one of our Advisory Editors, who has checked the nomenclature of most of the accounts in this volume and has been unsparing in his advice and suggestions. Dr W. T. Stearn has also generously given much assistance with nomenclatural problems. Other botanists who have assisted us in special ways include Mr P. D. Sell who has been responsible for the painstaking labour needed to prepare the index for the press, and Professor G. Wagenitz and Dr W. Gutermann who made valuable comments on many genera.
\par The University of Reading has continued to provide accommodation for the Secretariat in the Plant Science Laboratories and has handled the financial accounts of the project without charge. The Universities of Cambridge, Dublin, Leicester, Manchester and Ulster have also supported the members of the Editorial Committee in making facilities available to them. We owe a special debt of gratitude to Mrs Rosa Husain who has run the office at the Secretariat with great efficiency and loyalty.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\qc\lang2055\b\f0\fs24 PREFACE TO VOLUME 5\b0\fs28 
\par \pard 
\par The publication of this final volume of \i Flora Europaea\b  \b0\i0 represents a landmark in European floristics. The Editorial Committee has achieved its primary aim of producing a concise and complete Flora of the flowering plants and ferns of Europe in the shortest possible time. In practice, completion of the project has taken longer than the twelve years originally anticipated but very many problems had to be overcome, some of which are mentioned in the outline of the history of the \i Flora Europaea\b  \b0\i0 project given below.
\par This volume, devoted to the Monocotyledons, follows the same pattern as the preceding ones. Taxonomically the treatment of the Monocotyledons differs little from that of the Dicotyledons, although the pattern of variation conventionally accepted has led to the acceptance of a smaller proportion of subspecies than in previous volumes. Genera presenting special problems are few, but they include \i Allium\b  \b0\i0 and \i Ornithogalum\b , \b0\i0 some of the orchids, such as \i Dactylorhiza\b  \b0\i0 and \i Ophrys\b , \b0\i0 and some of the grasses, with \i Festuca \i0 outstanding. We are indebted to the numerous authors involved in the volume for their cooperation and understanding. Their manuscripts have been subject to the detailed editorial procedures established by the Editorial Committee over the years and it has to be reiterated that the Committee accepts full responsibility for the texts as they appear here.
\par The preparation of this volume has been financed by a final grant from the UK Science Research Council, which very generously agreed, following a year of support from other European Research Councils, to guarantee sufficient funds to enable the project to be completed. The Editorial Committee wishes to express, on behalf of the botanical community, its full appreciation of the Science Research Council's financial support which it has provided since 1959 when, as the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, it made an initial three-year grant for the project. Support on this scale for a taxonomic biological project in Europe is unprecedented and without it the \i Flora Europaea\b  \b0\i0 organization would simply have foundered.
\par The eighth and final \i Flora Europaea \i0 symposium was held in Cambridge in September 1977. Financial support was provided by the British Council, the Cambridge Philosophical Society, Cambridge University Press, the Linnean Society, the Science Research Council and the University Botanic Garden, Cambridge. It was a pleasure to welcome so many friends and colleagues to this highly successful meeting, during which the manuscript of this volume was handed over to the Press.
\par The preparation of the final volume of \i Flora Europaea\b  \b0\i0 has been undertaken with a very much reduced research and secretarial staff. Mr I.B.K. Richardson left to take up an appointment at the Herbarium, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in April 1976 and Mr A. O. Chater ceased his formal duties with the organization in Febmary 1977 and joined the staff of the British Museum (Natural History). Both of them have given long and loyal service to the organization, for which the Editorial Committee would like to express its deep appreciation. For the whole period of preparation of volume 5, all the secretarial and clerical duties have been undertaken single-handed by Mrs Rosa Husain. Her skill and accuracy in typing the many hundreds of pages of text in their various stages have been appreciated by all members of the organization and were a source of constant admiration on the part of the Committee. We wish to express our profound gratitude for all her untiring effort over a period of nine years.
\par 
\par A special tribute must be paid to the invaluable assistance given over the years by the late Mr J. E. Dandy, former Keeper of Botany, British Museum (Natural History). He applied his unrivalled skills in nomenclature and bibliography to the checking of the manuscripts and thus added a stamp of authority in these areas which the Flora would not otherwise have possessed. The extent of his labours was known to only a few of us who would regularly see him devoting whole days, even in his retirement, to painstaking routine checking, to detecting trivial errors (themselves often inexcusable in the first place) in the places of publication and page citations, as well as in unravelling the most complex nomenclatural problems with the delicate and sure skill of a surgeon. His untimely death in 1976 robbed us of his guidance for much of Volume 5 and we have been hard pressed to fill this gap. Professor Webb and Mr Chater, with the generous assistance of members of the Kew Herbarium staff, especially Mr R. D. Meikle, and also Dr R. K. Brummitt, have borne much of the burden of this nomenclatural and bibliographical work for the greater part of Volume 5. Professor W. T. Stearn, formerly of the British Museum (Natural History), has always been ready to assist us on matters bibliographical and nomenclatural and indeed was frequently involved with Mr Dandy in sorting out some of the more abstruse problems that arose. We are also indebted to Dr C. E. Hubbard, formerly Keeper of the Herbarium at Kew, for his assistance with the Gramineae. His unrivalled knowledge of the world's grasses has been valuable in many ways, particularly in delimiting and describing the tribes.
\par In a more general way we have received willing co-operation and assistance from the staff of the Herbarium and Library at both the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Department of Botany, British Museum (Natural History) during the preparation of this and previous volumes, and we wish to record our appreciation to them and to their respective Directors and Keepers.
\par The University of Reading has continued to provide accommodation for the Secretariat in the Plant Science Laboratories and has handled the financial accounts of the project without charge. The Universities of Cambridge, Dublin, Leicester, Manchester and Ulster have also supported members of the Editorial Committee in making facilities available to them.
\par We are grateful for the care and skill with which the staff of the Cambridge University Press have guided our manuscripts through the various stages to publication. Without their informed interest, help and patience the Flora might never have seen the light of day and certainly would not have been so convenient to use or such a tribute to the printer's art.
\par \i Flora Europaea\b  \b0\i0 has been from the start a cooperative venture and has depended by its very nature on its panels of Advisory Editors and Regional Advisers for advice, comments, corrections and additions to the draft manuscripts. We have been fortunate in being able to count on their support during the past twenty or so years and we are most grateful for their patience and cooperation volume after volume. Their individual contributions to the success of the project have varied widely according to circumstance and it would seem invidious to single out particular advisers; yet special mention should be made of the very great trouble taken by Professor I. do Amaral Franco and Dr J. Holub in checking almost every manuscript. The thoroughness and completeness of their work must have consumed a great deal of their time over the years and it is a pleasure to acknowledge this. It would be appropriate here to add a few words about the specialized duties of the members of the Editorial Committee, as distinct from family editorships. Professor Webb has from an early stage been responsible for the thankless task of editing the geographical information and later the ecological data. This has involved a great deal of very expert checking and revision of every single manuscript. Chromosome data have been the responsibility of Dr Walters and then Professor Moore. Mr Chater has undertaken the checking of citations for Volumes 2-5 and has performed the exceedingly intricate task of compiling Appendices I-III, which have attracted almost universal praise. Professor Heywood has had the responsibility since the inception of the project for running the Secretariat and for the general administration of the organization, a task in which Professor Moore has also shared in recent years.
\par The compilation of the index of each volume has been entrusted to Mr P. D. Sell, who has undertaken it with characteristic thoroughness. Finally we should like to acknowledge all those people and organizations who have assisted us with finance or by their general support and encouragement. \i Flora Europaea\b  \b0\i0 stands as a monument to international botanical cooperation and has set its mark on the taxonomic scene. This is a source of great satisfaction to the Editorial Committee and is in no small way a reward for its
\par efforts.

\par As Secretary to the Editorial Committee and one who has been closely involved with \i Flora Europaea\b  \b0\i0 from its earliest beginnings, I should like to add a few words of tribute to our Chairman, Professor Tutin, whose unflagging enthusiasm and determination during the twenty-two years that the planning, writing and editing of the Flora has taken has been an inspiration to us all. Through all the many vicissitudes of this period he has steadily worked away, always retaining his enthusiasm and underlying optimism. That we have now completed our \i magnum opus\b  \b0\i0 (an apposite term, for once) has been in no small measure due to him.

\par \i General notes\i0 
\par 
\par \i The sequence of families\i0  is that of Melchior in Engler, \i Syllabus  der Pflanzenfamilien\i0  ed. 12 (1964).
\par \i Descriptions of taxa\i0  refer only to the European populations of the taxon in question. If extra-European representatives differ substantially, an explanatory note is sometimes added.
\par \i Groups\i0  of species have been used in some genera where the species are very difficult to separate. These groups have no formal nomenclatural status and are simply a device to enable a partial identification to be made.
\par \i Taxa below the rank of subspecies\i0  are neither keyed nor described, and varieties are mentioned only when there are special reasons.
\par \i Aliens\i0  are included only when they appear to be effectively naturalized or when planted in continuous stands on a fairly large scale.
\par \i Hybrids\i0  are mentioned only when they occur frequently.
\par \i A measurement\i0\f1  given without qualification refers to length. Two measurements connected by \'d7 indicate length followed by width. Further measurements in parentheses indicate exceptional cases outside the normal range.\f0 
\par \i Synonyms\i0  given in the text are principally those names under which the species or subspecies is described in the Basic Floras listed on p. xix. The index contains (in addition to these) names which occur in any of the Standard Floras (p. xix) or in well-known monographs.
\par \i Chromosome numbers\i0  are given only when the editors are satisfied that the count has been made on correctly identified material known to be of wild European origin. For naturalized and cultivated species the count is from material which is naturalized or is cultivated in the way which justifies its inclusion in the Flora.
\par \i Ecological information\i0  is provided only when the habitat-preference of a species is sufficiently uniform over its European range to permit it to be summed up in a short phrase.
\par \i Geographical terms\i0  such as 'W. Europe', 'Mediterranean region', etc., are to be interpreted as shown on maps IV and V. The statement that a plant occurs in one or more of these regions does not necessarily imply that it occurs throughout the region.
\par \i Extra-European distribution\i0  is indicated only for those plants whose European range is small and whose range outside Europe is considerably greater, or for species which are not native in Europe.

\par  \b GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS\b0 
\par \pard 
\par The number of technical terms used in Flora Europaea has been kept as low as is consistent with a reasonable standard of accuracy and brevity. Most of them are used in well-established traditional senses, and their meanings may be ascertained by reference to glossaries such as H.I. Featherly,\i Taxonomic Terminology of the Higher Plants\i0  (Ames, Iowa, U.S.A., 1954). No term is used in a sense inconsistent with that given by Featherly.
\par Experience has shown, however, that some useful terms are liable to misinterpretation, and others, which can be used in a wider sense, are used in a restricted sense in \i Flora Europaea\i0 . This glossary is intended simply to indicate without ambiguity the sense in which these potentially ambiguous terms are employed.
\par Certain technical terms, which are restricted to descriptions in particular families or genera, are explained under the family or genus concerned.
\par 
\par ABOVE Used to indicate both the upper surface of a normally horizontal organ and the upper part of an organ or of the whole plant.
\par ACHENEA small, dry, 1-seeded, indehiscent fruit, whether derived from a superior or from an inferior ovary.
\par ALTERNATE Arising singly at a node; includes regularly spiral, as well as distichous arrangements.
\par ANNUAL Completing its life-cycle from seed to seed in less than 12 months; includes 'overwintering' annuals, which germinate in autumn and flower the following year.
\par BELOW Used to indicate the basal part of a plant, stem or inflorescence; cf. \i beneath\i0 .
\par BENEATH Used to indicate the lower surface of a normally horizontal organ; cf. \i below\i0 .
\par BIDENTATE With two teeth.
\par BISERRATE Serrate, With the teeth themselves serrate.
\par CADUCOUS Falling unusually early.
\par CILIATE With hairs on the margin.
\par DECIDUOUS Of leaves: falling in autumn; of other organs: falling before the majority of adjacent or associated organs.
\par \f1 ERECTO-PATENT Diverging at an angle of 15~45\'b0 from the axis on which the structure is borne.\f0 
\par FLOCCOSE Clothed with woolly hairs, which are disposed in tufts or tend to rub off and adhere in small masses.
\par GLABRESCENT Becoming glabrous with increasing age or maturity. For structures very slightly but persistently hairy the term subglabrous is used.
\par HIRSUTE Covered with long, moderately stiff and not inter-woven hairs.
\par HISPID Covered with stiff hairs or bristles.
\par LANATE Covered with soft, flexuous, intertwined hairs.
\par PELTATE Denotes an organ of which the stalk is attached to a more or less flat surface, and not to the margin; the attachment is not, however, necessarily central.
\par PUBERULENT With very short hairs.
\par PUBESCENT With soft, short hairs.
\par PYRENE A small stone, consisting of one or few seeds with a hard covering, enclosed in fleshy tissue, e.g.\i Arctostaphylos, Corema\i0 .
\par SEMI-PATENT Between patent and appressed.
\par SERICEOUS With silky, appressed hairs.
\par SETOSE Covered with stout, rigid bristles.
\par SIMPLE HAIR Indicates an unbranched hair; it may or may not bear a gland.
\par STOCK The persistent, usually somewhat woody base of an otherwise herbaceous perennial.
\par STOLON A short-lived, horizontal stem, either above or below the surface of the ground, rooting at one or more nodes.
\par STRIGOSE With stiff, appressed, straight hairs.
\par TERETE More or less cylindrical, without grooves or ridges.
\par TOMENTOSE With hairs compacted into a felty mass.
\par TUBERCULATE Covered with smooth, knob-like elevations.
\par VELUTINOUS With a dense indumentum of fine, soft, straight hairs.
\par VERRUCOSE Covered with rough, wart-like elevations.
\par VILLOUS Covered with long, soft, straight hairs.
